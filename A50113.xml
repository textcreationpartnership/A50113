            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HEre you have by the Press returned to you those Sermons of yours, which you some Years ago prepared for the Publick. Such were the Hazards and
<pb facs="tcp:93737:3"/> Deaths which they were in, that I believe their thus coming forth was lately altogether unexpected by you, and is now a great Surprizal to you. For surely you had no reason but to give them up as for ever lost in this World, (as I have in brief given an account in an Epistle to the Reader prefixed) however you might relieve your self with this Faith, that your good Will and Labour therein was with the Lord.
<pb facs="tcp:93737:3"/> Possibly that sentence of Death which they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might be some discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to you, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion some sad Thoughts. He who then helped you to receive it with a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Submission to him, without whom not a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row lights on the ground, and who numbers the very Hairs of our Heads, and hath a Soveraign Right (which may neither be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled nor questioned) to dispose of us, and all ours,
<pb facs="tcp:93737:4"/> as pleaseth Him, now lets you see it was not in vain to commit them unto Him. Whatever the Workings of your Heart were under that disappointment, I am perswaded you will now receive them as a return unto, and a token of the acceptance of those Prayers which you followed them withal when you first took up a purpose to Publish them, and did accordingly commit them unto Him who hath so Faithfully,
<pb facs="tcp:93737:4"/> so Marvellously preserved them, and hath now at last, through so many Deaths, brought them forth unto Light. Now God, who is able to make all Grace abound towards you, and doth minister Seed to the Sower, and preserve it when perishing, increase his Gifts and Grace in you, and multiply your Seed sown and the Fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to your Comfort, the Good of many, and the
<pb facs="tcp:93737:5"/> Glory of his own Grace. So prayeth,</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT hath been observed concerning some Persons designed by God for Eminent Usefulness in their day, that great Dangers and great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances have befallen them in their beginning times. Somewhat such alike Fate hath attended these Sermons. They have been in Perils on the Sea, in Perils by Robbers, in Perils among Papists and Publick Enemies, in Perils in a strange
<pb facs="tcp:93737:6"/> Land, yea in Deaths often. But there hath been a wakeful Eye, and a mighty Hand of Providence over them all along. They were by the Author designed and prepared for the Publick, and to that end written out for the Press, and sent some Years ago for <hi>Old England</hi> from <hi>New,</hi> in a Vessel which fell into the Hands of a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, by whom both Ship and Passengers were carried into <hi>France.</hi> But a Person there who had some acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Privateer, obtained of him these and other Papers which were of no value to him, who was then Possessor of them. That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sent them to a Correspondent he had in <hi>London;</hi> who occasionally giving a Worthy Acquaintance of
<pb facs="tcp:93737:6"/> mine a view of them, he presently discerned what these Discourses were, and for what designed, and by him they were shown to me. At first sight I knew the Hand in which they were written, and on further Perusal could not but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive on them very discernable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses of the Spirit of their Author, of whom the nearness of my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forbids me to say any thing, only this I must testifie, that these Sermons are assuredly his true and genuine Issue.</p>
            <p>The forementioned Wakefulness of the Eye of Providence over them in all the Hazards and Deaths which they have passed through, and at last, in his own time, so bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them forth unto the Publick,
<pb facs="tcp:93737:7"/> may give a ground of hope that God hath designed them for further Usefulness and Service.</p>
            <p>The Subjects treated on are weighty, of general concernment, and never out of season; although perhaps in some of them the Author might have an eye more especially to the present circumstances of many in that place where they were first meditated and uttered. The Holy Ghost himself took occasion to indite many parts of Holy Scripture from some present Occurrences in a small part of Gods People: And these hath he preserved and consecrated to the use of the whole Church all the World over unto the end of time. Nor is it a new thing for Holy Men of God, not immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
<pb facs="tcp:93737:7"/> to publish to the World those Labours of theirs to which they were first stirred up by some emergencies among that People where they were set. A great Divine tells us, That the Case of those to whom he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred was one thing by which he was much influenced in pitching on the Subjects which he Preached on. Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> Preface to <hi>Spiritual-mindedness.</hi> Such a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gifts, and the Fruits of them, is one sweet and happy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Communion of Saints.</p>
            <p>The manner of this Authors trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on these Subjects is such, as that it is apparent he did indeavour to approve himself to God therein; and therefore I doubt not, but as
<pb facs="tcp:93737:8"/> others of his Labours have, so these will commend themselves to every Mans Conscience in the sight of God, especially of those who are Spiritual, and by reason of use have their Senses exercised to discern between Good and Evil. The Blessing of God go along with them.</p>

But there is a further, and a viler step of <hi>Impiety,</hi> which a woful part of Mankind, praecipitate themselves unto; and that is, <hi>An hearkening to the Temptations of the Devil, rather than to the Proposals of the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Holy Lord.</hi> A sad Instance of this we have in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93737:10"/> that wretched <hi>Ananias,</hi> whom the words now read were spoken unto.</p>
            <p>In the 28th Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> we read concerning one <hi>Ananias,</hi> an ungodly Minister, whom God punished with a sudden Death for his Iniquity; and in the 5th Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> now before us, we also read of one <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi> as it seems, an ungodly Minister too, whom God likewise punished with a sudden Death for his Iniquity. The Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had erected a <hi>Bank</hi> among them, for the relief of their Poor, Distressed, Afflicted Brethren. In the places of the most Prosperity, and of the best Regulation, the <hi>Poor</hi> that live upon Charity usually make about a <hi>Thirtieth</hi> part of the People; but among the Primitive Christians, which the Lord chiefly chose among <hi>The Poor of this World,</hi> we may imagine a greater proportion of Needy ones. For the Comfort of these Godly <hi>Poor,</hi> many Gentlemen of good Estates, not only gave their <hi>Revenues,</hi> but even sold their <hi>Fee Simples,</hi> as far as they thought it proper for them, and made a <hi>Stock</hi> which the Apostles became <hi>Trustees</hi> for the well-disposing of.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Ananias,</hi> with his Wife, pretending to follow this Example, yet secretly detained part of the <hi>Price</hi> which they had received for an <hi>House</hi> or <hi>Farm,</hi> on this occasion alienated.</p>
            <p>Our Text is the terrible Expostulation of the Apostle towards this deceitful Man: <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine Heart?</hi> There are two things implyed in it. First, That he had been <hi>carried,</hi> yea, and <hi>burried</hi> on to a most horrible
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93737:10"/> Sin, by the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the <hi>Devil.</hi> And next, That it was his own <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Fault,</hi> which gave the Devil this Advantage over him; there was his own <hi>Consent</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> in hearkening to the <hi>Temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not yet ready to give you the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which you are waiting for; we must first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our Context▪ and from thence fetch two remarkable Consequences of this unhappy Mans being thus <hi>Filled by the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Consequence of it was, A prodigious <hi>Wickedness.</hi> 'Tis charged upon <hi>Ananias,</hi> that he <hi>ly'd unto the Holy Spirit.</hi> I cannot find how to bring him in guilty of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> tho' more than a Jury of <hi>Interpreters</hi> have brought in that Verdict also against him: But we find him guilty of grievous <hi>Dissimulation</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> He seemed as if he had been very <hi>liberal,</hi> and no less forward and sincere in foregoing his Possessions for the Publick Use, than the best of them all; but he did not really do, what he openly declared and professed for the doing of. Indeed, the Man was afraid lest he should him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self come to want before he dyed; he durst not rely upon the Faithfulness of God, which alwayes provides well for the Charitable Man, so <hi>he kept back part of the Price.</hi> However thought he, <hi>I'll make a show, they shall never take me for a Niggard!</hi> This is called, <hi>A lying to the Holy Spirit,</hi> because it was a going to put a Trick upon those Persons that had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Measure and Power of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in them: For besides the committing of this Knavery in a <hi>Church-Assembly,</hi> wherein there is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93737:11"/> a special Presence of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostles, which had the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in them, to a Miracle. <hi>Vain Man, hadst thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the story of</hi> Gehazi? <hi>That like him, thou shouldest not fear a discovery by the Holy Spirit of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Consequence of it was, An horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous <hi>Misery.</hi> 'Tis reported of <hi>Ananias</hi> here, That <hi>hearing these words, he fell down and gave up the ghost.</hi> At the beginning of the <hi>Jewish-Church,</hi> a double dealing with God was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed with a deadly Revenge; of which <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> was an Instance; thus at the beginning of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> in such a case we see not unlike Judgments executed. The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> had newly wrought a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> behold, he now works a Miracle of <hi>Severity,</hi> to testifie the Exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ. I remember the old Pagan <hi>Porphyrius</hi> exclaimed against <hi>Peter,</hi> as a bloody, cruel Man, for this transaction; but <hi>he</hi> might have remembered, it was not the <hi>Apostle,</hi> it was the <hi>Almighty,</hi> that killed this Malefactor; and some have an <hi>hope,</hi> if it be not a fond one, that he <hi>repented</hi> while he was expiring; yea, that the Troubles and Sorrows of his Repentance were the things that smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him. Here is only this further <hi>Mystery</hi> to be wondered at, That <hi>Peter</hi> himself had but a few Weeks before been guilty of as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Lying, as this poor Creature here; but upon his <hi>weeping bitterly,</hi> the Lord forgave him, even so far as to imploy him in passing a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sentence upon one that thus transgressed. O
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93737:11"/> the Soveraignty of Grace! <hi>Lord! how unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are tby Judgments!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Doctrine will now of its own accord fall into our hands: 'Tis this,
<q>That when Men permit Satan, with his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to fill their Hearts, they are in the high road unto all manner of Wickedness and Misery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are Three Propositions that now lye before us.</p>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <head>
                  <hi>PROP.</hi> I.</head>
               <p>There is a <hi>Devil,</hi> whose Imployment it is to <hi>tempt</hi> the poor Children of Men.</p>
               <p>Let us a little examine every Article in this Proposition. We say then, <hi>There is a Devil.</hi> Would you know what a <hi>Devil</hi> is? We have a description of him in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. <hi>A spiritual wickedness, in high places.</hi> That is, a <hi>wicked Spirit,</hi> lodged in the Atmosphere <hi>above</hi> and <hi>about</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> which we walk upon. A <hi>Devil</hi> is properly <hi>a Fallen Angel;</hi> and so he must be <hi>a Rational Spirit, full of enmity against God and Man.</hi> There was a vast company of <hi>Angels,</hi> whereof the Apostle tells us, in <hi>Jude</hi> 6. <hi>They kept not their first estate</hi> (namely that of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Happiness) <hi>but left their own habitation</hi> (which was in the Heavenly Regions) <hi>and God has reserved them for everlasting chains under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93737:12"/> This Hellish Crue of <hi>wicked Spirits,</hi> is called, <hi>the Devil</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> in the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and it is worth enquiring, <hi>why?</hi> For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>that.</hi> It is not because they are <hi>one</hi> in point of <hi>Individuation.</hi> Alas, there are incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly many <hi>Legions</hi> of them: We read in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.30. of above Twelve Thousand which could be spared at once to keep <hi>Garrison</hi> in one single Man. But the Devils are all as <hi>one</hi> upon these two accounts; both of which the 12th Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> gives us Instructions about: They are <hi>one</hi> for their <hi>agreement;</hi> they all espouse <hi>one</hi> Design, and follow <hi>one</hi> Business; they don't fall out among themselves: And then also, they are <hi>one</hi> for their <hi>Government;</hi> there is a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> among them; and they are all united under one <hi>Prince,</hi> the Commands and Orders of which <hi>Grand Seigniour</hi> they all yield the most exact Obedience to. This is <hi>the Devil!</hi> But what is the <hi>Imployment</hi> of these <hi>wicked Spirits</hi> here? Why, for that we say, <hi>Temptation is the imployment of the Devil.</hi> There are three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Names by which this Tygre is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished: and there is a reference to <hi>Temptation</hi> in them all. He is called, the <hi>Satan,</hi> and the <hi>Tempter,</hi> and the <hi>Devil. Before</hi> he sets upon us, then he is a <hi>Satan;</hi> that is, a malicious and a malignant <hi>Adversary;</hi> he <hi>hates</hi> us infinitely, and longs to see us miserable. <hi>After</hi> he sets upon us, then he is a <hi>Devil;</hi> that is, a clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Accuser;</hi> he will traduce us, and reproach us, at the <hi>Courts</hi> in the invisible World, where the Lord gives out his Commissions about our Concernments here. But while he is at work
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93737:12"/> with us, all that while he is our <hi>Tempter.</hi> To <hi>tempt</hi> a Man is properly to perswade him, and seduce him to some evil thing. We all owe a continual <hi>Allegiance</hi> unto God, and it is as well our <hi>Interest</hi> as our <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>acknowledge him in all our wayes.</hi> Now the Devil by his <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> is evermore solliciting us to deny unto our God something of the <hi>Homage</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> that is due unto him, and leave the <hi>Paths</hi> wherein we shall <hi>find rest unto our souls.</hi> He has a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Propensity and Inclination to this <hi>Devilish</hi> work; and inveterate <hi>Custom</hi> of more than Five Thousand Years, has doubtless increased that <hi>Habit</hi> in him. If you ask <hi>how</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our <hi>Tempter?</hi> I must Answer, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tis more <hi>immediately;</hi> he has inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable wayes of applying himself unto our Souls, and of pressing and pushing them unto many sinful exorbitancies. But sometimes 'tis more <hi>mediately:</hi> The <hi>Men</hi> of the World, and the <hi>Things</hi> of the World, are the <hi>Tools</hi> with which he operates upon us; by these he throwes the <hi>Sparks</hi> of Hell upon our Lusts, until he has made them flame and rage into the worst of all abominations. If you ask, <hi>why</hi> the Devil becomes our <hi>Tempter?</hi> I must Answer, 'Tis partly out of <hi>Malice</hi> at God. He would fain be in the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, and he cannot endure that God should have any Subjects or Children in the World. And partly, 'tis out of <hi>Envy</hi> at Man. He cannot brook it, that <hi>Man</hi> should be Saved, and <hi>he</hi> be Damned; that <hi>Man</hi> should be Crowned, and <hi>he</hi> be Chained; that <hi>Man</hi> should be in the <hi>Bosom</hi> of God, and he lye in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93737:13"/> the <hi>bottom</hi> of Hell for ever. 'Tis <hi>this</hi> that puts him upon <hi>tempting,</hi> and vexing and plaguing of us all.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Temptations</hi> of the Devil sometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail so far as to <hi>fill the Hearts</hi> of the Men whom they are used upon. Many Men are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the Temptations of the <hi>Devil,</hi> that they let him into their <hi>Hearts,</hi> and their Hearts then become as full of the <hi>Devil</hi> as ever they can hold. There are two or three things, in regard of which the <hi>Devil</hi> sometimes <hi>fills</hi> the Heart of a miserable Sinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Devil <hi>blinds</hi> the Heart of a Sinner, and so he <hi>fills</hi> the Heart of him. We read concerning them that are <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> is called, <hi>The prince of darkness;</hi> and it is an Hellish <hi>darkness</hi> which he clouds the Mind of a Sinner with. The Devil so <hi>blinds</hi> the Mind of many a Man with his Temptations, that he can't see the <hi>way wherein he should go;</hi> he calls <hi>evil good, and good evil;</hi> and he is plunged into <hi>damnable delusions.</hi> The Devil perverts the <hi>understanding</hi> of many a Man, and makes him either to see <hi>nothing,</hi> or to think <hi>amiss</hi> of all sacred things. The Sinner having his eyes put out, the <hi>Devil</hi> now makes the Man to <hi>grind</hi> for him in all manner of Iniquity. When once the Devil has thus muffled and hood-winked a poor Sinner, he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93737:13"/>
                  <hi>fills</hi> him with all confusion; and he brags, <hi>Now the Man is mine for ever!</hi> The Devil does what he will with a Sinner, when once he has made a <hi>dark Dungeon</hi> of his wretched Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Devil <hi>gains</hi> the Heart of a Sinner, and so likewise he <hi>fills</hi> the Heart of him. This <hi>Victory</hi> of the Devil over a Sinner has two degrees to the compleating of it. First, The Devil <hi>enters</hi> the Heart of the Sinner. When an hideous Man once became <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> 'tis said in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.3. <hi>Then Satan entred into him.</hi> The Devil does <hi>besiege</hi> the Soul of a woful Man with his Temptations; at last the poor Man delivers up the Keys of the Castle, and e'en lets the Devil <hi>enter</hi> with all his Forces there. The Devil gets all the <hi>Faculties</hi> of the Soul in his possession; so that after this, he has the <hi>Intellect</hi> of the Man to argue for <hi>him,</hi> the <hi>Memory</hi> of the Man to be <hi>his</hi> Treasury, and all the <hi>Affections</hi> of the Man to side with <hi>his</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>his</hi> Intents. As that sorry King said once to the <hi>Syrian, I am thine, and all that I have:</hi> So the Sinner overcome with Temptations, at length sayes to the Devil, <hi>Here, take my Heart, it is thine, and all that I have.</hi> When 'tis come to this pass, then; Secondly, The Devil <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> the Heart of the Sinner. 'Tis said about such as are <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>They are in the snare of the Devil, taken captive by him at his will.</hi> With his Temptations the Devil so far prevails against a woful Sinner, that he has the poor Man in a <hi>Toyl;</hi> the Devil can drag him hither and thither, and e'en do what he will with him. The Devil becomes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93737:14"/> the absolute Commander of his undone Soul: If the Devil say, <hi>Come,</hi> he comes; if the Devil say, <hi>Go,</hi> he goes; if the Devil say. <hi>Do this,</hi> he does it, and he cannot for his life do otherwise. Temptations prove to the Sinner like a <hi>Spiders web;</hi> the Devil even rolls up the silly Fly in his cursed Cobwebs; and though he flutters and struggles a little, yet he sucks out the Heart-blood of him when ever he pleases. Thus 'tis when the Devil <hi>fills</hi> the Hearts of Men. But that we may make a full <hi>conclusion</hi> of this <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> take this one <hi>Conclusion</hi> to perfect what we have begun to say.</p>
               <p>'Tis our <hi>hearkening</hi> to the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the Devil, that gives him opportunity thus to <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>gain,</hi> and <hi>fill</hi> our Hearts. He cannot so come at us, as to <hi>fill</hi> us, unless by our <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances</hi> with his <hi>Temptations</hi> we open the doors of our Souls unto him. We find in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.2. our Mother did first <hi>parley</hi> with the Devil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could prevail upon her; but when once he had so far prevailed as to make her <hi>yield,</hi> she was then quickly <hi>full</hi> of him. 'Tis our <hi>yielding</hi> to the Devil that procures his <hi>filling</hi> of us. The <hi>Devil</hi> could not throw our Saviour, although he had him on the <hi>Battlement</hi> or the <hi>Gallery</hi> of the Temple; he said, <hi>Cast thy self down.</hi> Thus the Devil must have a Mans own consent before he can <hi>fill</hi> the Man. And every time we hearken to a Temptation of his, we do somewhat permit his filling of us.</p>

            <div n="3" type="proposition">

                  <hi>PROP.</hi> III.</head>
               <p>When once the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the Devil have prevailed so far as to <hi>fill</hi> the Hearts of Men. they go on to all <hi>wickedness</hi> and <hi>misery.</hi> And this will be evident from these Considerations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When <hi>Satan</hi> fills the Hearts of Men, there is a desperate and an horrible <hi>madness</hi> in them. A Natural <hi>madness</hi> is often caused by the Influence of the Devil upon the Children of Men. It was a common Sentiment among the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, That <hi>madness</hi> was oftentimes produced by the <hi>Energy</hi> of <hi>Evil Spirits;</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if the <hi>madness</hi> were <hi>Jine Febri.</hi> Some <hi>Devil</hi> 'tis which raises the <hi>Poysonous Fires</hi> in poor Men, to such an heat and heighth as causes a <hi>madness</hi> in them. Hence twas said concerning a <hi>mad Man,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.15, 18. <hi>He is Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;</hi> that is, one distracted at certain times of the <hi>Moon;</hi> and it follows, <hi>Jesus rebuked the Devil.</hi> Be sure there is a <hi>Spiritual Madness</hi> which the Devil causes in the Hearts which he has made himself owner of. When a Sinner has once resigned himself unto the Devil, it may be said of him, as in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Madness is in his heart;</hi> and then he will stick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though it should prove never so <hi>deadly</hi> to him. What was blasphemously said of our Saviour, may very righteously be said of a Sinner, in <hi>John</hi> 10.20. <hi>He hath a Devil, and is mad.</hi> But when once a Man is <hi>mad,</hi> what is there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o hinder him from the utmost <hi>wickedness</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93737:15"/> and <hi>misery?</hi> The more <hi>unreasonable</hi> any thing is, 'tis the more agreeable to a Sinner that is acted by the Devil; he has upon him that Plague. <hi>To be smitten with Madness and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and astonishment of Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When <hi>Satan</hi> fills the Hearts of Men, he will have wayes to <hi>reconcile</hi> them unto the most formidable Impieties in the World. There are certain <hi>pretended Arguments</hi> that the Devil has to perswade all manner of Sins withal; and when once he is got into the Heart of a Man, he can give a strange Force and Strength to those <hi>vain Pretences.</hi> The Devil will perswade the Heart of such a Man, that Sin is a very <hi>Pleasurable</hi> thing. He so vitiates the taste of him, that he thinks, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Stolen waters are sweet.</hi> He now finds that <hi>sweetness</hi> in unlawful things, which 'tis impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain his Appetites unto: It meerly bewitches him, and he becomes like that poor Man, who being told that he must <hi>leave his Drinking,</hi> or <hi>lose his Eye-sight;</hi> replyed, <hi>Then farewel these poor Eyes of mine.</hi> The Devil will also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Heart of such a Man, that Sin is a very <hi>necessary</hi> thing. He urges upon him that which he pressed upon our Saviour, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.3. <hi>It is for Bread;</hi> you'll starve, you'll dye, if you do it not. He now imagines that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the doing of unlawful things, he is utterly undone in the World; and if he can say once, <hi>The thing is needful,</hi> he will never trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whether it be <hi>sinful</hi> or no. In the mean time, there is but <hi>one thing</hi> to withhold the Sinner from the worst Abominations in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93737:15"/> World; and this <hi>one thing</hi> does the Devil keep a cruel <hi>muzzle</hi> upon. When a Sinner is rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on to his own ruine, his Conscience, <hi>that</hi> stands in his way, as the Angel did with a drawn Sword, in <hi>Balaams</hi> of old; that stands and cryes, and pleads, <hi>O do not this abominable thing!</hi> But when the Devil is in a Mans Heart, he claps a strange <hi>Extinguisher</hi> upon that <hi>Candle of the Lord.</hi> The Devil has a way now to <hi>bribe</hi> the Conscience of a Sinner. As we read of some in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Their Conscience is defiled;</hi> so the Devil will often debauch the Conscience of a Man at such a rate, that <hi>Conscience</hi> will even turn <hi>Advocate</hi> for unlawful things; the Man will now commit the most unparallell'd Villanies, and yet say, <hi>I verily thought that I ought to do many such things:</hi> Or at least, the Devil has a way to <hi>sear</hi> the Conscience of a Sinner, We read in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. about <hi>a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science seared with an hot iron.</hi> Thus the Devil will <hi>cauterise</hi> the <hi>Conscience</hi> of a Man, till he may cut it, and wound it, with all manner of Guilt, and yet never be touched with any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse at all. Behold, whether you do not now see a Sinner galloping apace towards the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest <hi>wickedness</hi> and <hi>misery!</hi> And what is there to stop his furious careers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When <hi>Satan</hi> fills the Hearts of Men, he inspires them with a desperate <hi>Enmity</hi> against the most probable Instruments of their eternal good. The Devil makes Men very impatient of <hi>Reproof;</hi> and when he is got into the Hearts of them, one had as good <hi>meet a Bear bereaved of her whelps,</hi> as go to controul them in their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93737:16"/> evil wayes. The Almighty God has his <hi>Officers</hi> in the World, whose Work 'tis to keep Sinners from the Destruction which they would bring upon themselves; 'tis <hi>to pull them as brands o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of the fire.</hi> But alas, these <hi>Fire-brands</hi> of Hell will only black and burn those that shall faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully go to meddle with them. The only way to save a self-destroying Sinner, is, <hi>to tell him the Truth.</hi> But if you dare to do that, you shall soon complain, like <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Am I become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</hi> When the <hi>Devil</hi> has hurled a poor Sinner into the <hi>horrible pits</hi> of Sin, he presently makes a meer <hi>Dog</hi> of him; so that like a <hi>Dog,</hi> he'll snap and snarl at any one that shall go to pull him out; and there is no Remedy but he must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish there.</p>
               <p>Hence 'tis that a Zealous Minister of God is usually an extream and odious <hi>Eye-sore</hi> to such a Sinner: Of a Faithful Minister he'll say, as <hi>Ahab</hi> of that Prophet, in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8. <hi>As for that man, I hate him:</hi> And he could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent if all the Servants of the Lord were served as once Fourscore of them were by the <hi>Arian</hi> Persecutors, There have been dreadful and bloody <hi>Storms</hi> in all Ages raised against the true Ministers of God; but they have all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the efficacy of the Devil on the <hi>Hearts</hi> of evil Men. If more than Twenty Hundred Holy Men of God should all be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced in one day, these would be admirably pleased with it, and wish, <hi>That the mouths of them all were in like manner stopt.</hi> Why, what's the matter? 'Tis because these Ministers would
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93737:16"/> save Men from the <hi>Paths of the Destroyer;</hi> these Ministers would bring Men to a Saving Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Communion with the Blessed God. They might indeed beg, as the Apostle did, <hi>Forgive us this wrong!</hi> But when People have the Devil in them, the Pastors never shall be forgiven so great an Injury; the <hi>Witnesses</hi> of the Lord Jesus must, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them which dwell on the Earth.</hi> Yea, the more Eminent any Minister shall be, for his Desire and Power, <hi>to do good unto all,</hi> the more shall such a Minister be maligned, reproached, reviled in the World. There was once a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet very remarkable for his undaunted and unwearied Pains to make all his Neighbours Happy; but the Complements bestowed still upon that Minister of God, were those in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Thou art he which troubles Israel;</hi> said they, we owe all our <hi>Troubles</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of <hi>that</hi> Man; 'tis <hi>he</hi> that has caused all our uncomfortable <hi>Revolutions.</hi> It were well for us, if <hi>he,</hi> and all such, were hanged out of the way. Never shall any Man do much good for the Souls of his Neighbours, but the World will treat him as they did the excellent <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> of old; they will spit the basest and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Venom upon him; and when they can do nothing else, they ll write Libels, wherein, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne scelus viro sancto objicitur,</hi> to render him not capable of being any further serviceable. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, there are some sorts of <hi>Sectaries</hi> more peculiarly acted by the Devil, in storming at the Ministers of God. When the <hi>Devil</hi> got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> he was, I conceive, taken
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93737:17"/> with a <hi>Lycanthropy,</hi> a Disease which gives a Man the Temper and Motion of a <hi>Wolf.</hi> Why when the <hi>Devil</hi> gets into some Hereticks, he makes <hi>Wolves</hi> of them, and they fall a <hi>barking</hi> presently, and this, as is proper, chiefly at the <hi>Shepherds</hi> of the Flock; the best Name they can find for them, is <hi>Dogs,</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi> These are things that push on the <hi>wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> of a poor Sinner into a depth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all recovery; who shall fetch them back, if their <hi>Ministers</hi> be made incapable?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When <hi>Satan</hi> fills the Hearts of Men, he makes them rush upon such hardy <hi>ventures</hi> as they must be utterly and for ever spoiled with. The Devil will make Sinners very <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turesome,</hi> when once he becomes a <hi>Commander</hi> over them. The Devil is their <hi>Driver;</hi> and what can the event now be, but this; <hi>They shall be suddenly broken to pieces, and there shall be no Remedy!</hi> We read of certain <hi>Swine</hi> which had the <hi>Devil</hi> in them, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</hi> The Devil does inchant poor Sinners by the delicious but poysonous <hi>Cups</hi> of Sin, into such <hi>Swine</hi> as those; so he'll <hi>run</hi> them over the most amazing Precipice in the World, and they shall throw themselves into a <hi>deep,</hi> without fear of <hi>choaking</hi> there. I'll tell you who was one of them <hi>Swine;</hi> 'twas <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> bloody <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Who would have imagined that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could have been so fool-hardy as to venture into the <hi>Red Sea</hi> after all the plagues and signs of his approaching ruine? But having the <hi>Devil</hi> in him, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93737:17"/> in till <hi>the Sea covered him, and he sank as Lead in the mighty waters.</hi> The obdurate <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> of this World have many and many a time seen, that the great God brings the <hi>Seas,</hi> yea an whole Ocean of Judgments upon them that hinder this <hi>Instituted Worship</hi> in their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories; and yet they still venture upon this destructive Policy, till one after another they all perish in the <hi>waters;</hi> but now the <hi>Devil</hi> knowes the Reason of it. In <hi>Rev</hi> 20.8. we read of a greater venture yet, that shall be made near the last of the <hi>latter dayes,</hi> by an odd Race of ungodly Men; and what emboldens it? Why the <hi>Devil shall deceive the Nations</hi> into an expedition that shall bring <hi>Fire from Heaven</hi> upon them all.</p>
               <p>The greatest venture ever made by a Mortal Creature, is in <hi>persecuting</hi> the People of God. The Church of God is truly called, <hi>A burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Stone;</hi> it alwayes breaks the Backs of them that will be heaving at it: And that <hi>Stone</hi> yet lies, and lives, and growes, and God will yet make a glorious <hi>Mountain</hi> of it. The Lord Christ has told us, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.44. <hi>Whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</hi> 'Tis an allusion to the capital Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Stoning,</hi> used among the <hi>Jewes</hi> of old: They first gave the Malefactor a thrust, which made him fall with his Loins upon a great <hi>Stone;</hi> and then they cast that great <hi>Stone</hi> upon the Man himself: If this dispatched him not, the Executioners threw more <hi>Stones</hi> upon him. This then is the Assertion of our Saviour, If
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93737:18"/> Men will go to afflict, abuse and oppress the People of God, the Great God will <hi>stone</hi> them to Death for it; and there will need no other <hi>stone,</hi> but the cause and the cry of that oppressed People to do their business for them. And yet a vast party of poor Mankind are making this desperate <hi>venture</hi> every day; the whole World is full of <hi>Persecution,</hi> wherever you can find any Objects for old <hi>Cains</hi> Club to be used up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Tis now from the Malice of the <hi>Devil</hi> that all <hi>Persecution</hi> does arise; 'tis the <hi>Devil</hi> that makes Men so venturesome as to wrong the Church of God. It is said in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The devil shall cast some of you into prison, and ye shall have tribulation ten dayes;</hi> referring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to <hi>Trajans</hi> Persecution. 'Tis the <hi>Devil</hi> that makes Men to <hi>imprison,</hi> and smite, and kill their more pious Neighbours.</p>
               <p>What shall I say more? Can there be a greater venture, than for a vile Man to <hi>challenge</hi> and <hi>combate</hi> the Infinite God himself? Said the Lord in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the dayes that I shall deal with thee?</hi> Tis the most outragious <hi>Phrensie</hi> that ever was, for a silly Worm to enter into a <hi>Battle</hi> against the Omnipotent God; for a sorry Potsherd of the Earth, to make his Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon that God who <hi>overturns the mountains in his anger, and makes the very pillars of heaven to tremble.</hi> But the Devil every day causes this <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93737:18"/> Doubtlesss the <hi>Devil</hi> knew Jesus to be the Son of God, and yet the daring wretch would make an assault upon that Glorious One. Why, such a venturesome Disposition does the <hi>Devil</hi> cause in the Souls that belong unto him, that they will fly upon the Almighty God himself; it may be said of them as in <hi>Job</hi> 15.25, 26. <hi>He stretches out his hand against God, he strengthens himself against the Almighty, he runs upon the thick bosses of his buckler.</hi> All the Attributes of God are turned upon irreclaimable Sinners, like so many pointed sharpened <hi>Bosses of a Buckler;</hi> but when they are acted by the Devil, they will push upon these terrible <hi>Bosses.</hi> They do like the mad <hi>Caligula;</hi> when the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thunders in Heaven, they go with little squibbing Rockets to thunder back again upon him. The Prophet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

What is there now to keep a Sinner from the utmost <hi>wickedness</hi> and <hi>misery?</hi> Alas, what won't Men do when the <hi>Devil's</hi> in them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> When <hi>Satan</hi> fills the Hearts of Men, he keeps them from all good <hi>Impressions</hi> by the means of Grace upon them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Devil</hi> will, if he can, cause Men to live without any means of Grace at all; he will get them to dwell in <hi>the region of the shadow of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93737:19"/> death;</hi> even in those places where they <hi>perish for the lack of Vision.</hi> We find, that when the <hi>Devil</hi> was got into <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.16. <hi>He went out from the presence of the Lord:</hi> So the <hi>Devil</hi> causes Men to go away from the House, away from the Institutions, and away from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord Jesus Christ. When the <hi>Silver-Trumpets</hi> of the Lord Jesus were to sound in the other <hi>Hemisphere</hi> of our World, the <hi>Devil</hi> got a forlorn Crue over hither into <hi>America,</hi> in hopes that the Gospel never would come at them here; and he still gets incredible multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and myriads of People elsewhere to live like our <hi>Indians,</hi> without the <hi>Gospel of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> among them.</p>
               <p>But where the Devil cannot make Men so barbarous as to live altogether <hi>without</hi> the means of Grace, he will cause them so to attend upon those means, as to find no profit by them. We are told of some in <hi>Mark</hi> 4.15. <hi>When they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.</hi> Thus, the Devil will entice people to stay away from the House of God, upon very trivolous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Excuses: There shall be a <hi>Lecture</hi> in a Town, and not one seventh part of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants be present at it, that they may <hi>hear the words whereby they may be saved;</hi> perhaps, if it be but a little cold, then they'll keep at home when they should be hearing the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> and they have got, they think, a Scripture too for doing so; <hi>That God will have Mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi> 'Tis possible they'll promise in the mean time to <hi>read a Chapter in</hi> Job; and if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93737:19"/> they do, I wish it may be the Fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there. But if they come and sit among the People of God, how do they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? Their <hi>Minds</hi> are <hi>wandering</hi> with a very deadly fickleness; they are Buying, Selling, Travelling, or perhaps plunging themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cursed Adulteries, with a <hi>Fancy</hi> roving to <hi>the ends of the Earth.</hi> Why, the <hi>Devil</hi> has carried them out a Hunting with him. And it is well if their <hi>Eyes</hi> been't <hi>sleeping</hi> too; many will even set themselves to sleep in that place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a true Child of <hi>Jacob</hi> would say, <hi>How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this place! 'Tis the House of God, and the Gate of Heaven!</hi> Why, 'tis the <hi>Devil</hi> that rocks the Cradle for them. Yea, 'tis usual for the Devil to make Men <hi>carp,</hi> and <hi>cavil,</hi> and <hi>quarrel</hi> at what is delivered in the House of God, when they should be thereby rather converted from their evil wayes. They'll <hi>rail,</hi> or <hi>scoff,</hi> or like <hi>Stephens</hi> Hearers, they will gnash their <hi>Teeth</hi> at the Heralds of Heaven; but, alas, they will not <hi>mend</hi> at the Dispensations of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>We have seen some under a Bodily molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> to stop their Ears, and roar and faint when any good thing was to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Room, that so they might be sure to hear nothing of it. Why, <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> make Men continually do what is equivalent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; even to deprive themselves of all benefit by the means of Grace; and what will then become of them? What <hi>wickedness</hi> or <hi>misery</hi> can they be refrained from?</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93737:23"/> themselves; they grow discontented with such an <hi>estate</hi> and <hi>station</hi> as God has placed them in; and they look with a strange disdain upon those whom they reckon their <hi>Inferiours:</hi> Yea, 'tis well if they don't arrogate some <hi>excellency</hi> to themselves, which they never were owners of; if they don't ascribe to themselves those things which they never had, which they never did, which they ought never to pretend unto. But who is it that has thus inflamed the Hearts of Men! Truly the <hi>Devil</hi> is that <hi>Leviathan</hi> who is <hi>King over the Children of Pride;</hi> and his <hi>ruling</hi> of them is by his <hi>filling</hi> of them. When the Devil is in the <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men, he often <hi>swells</hi> them with a <hi>Tympany</hi> that is much discoursed of by the writers of those matters. Thus he does when he is in the Hearts of Men; he <hi>swells</hi> them with a very Diabolical <hi>Tympany.</hi> When you see a silly little <hi>Frogg</hi> swelling towards the dimensions of an <hi>Oxe,</hi> you may be sure 'tis from some inflation of the Devil in him. Here are more to whom we may say, <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Devil</hi> has fill'd the <hi>Heart,</hi> when <hi>Drink</hi> has fill'd the <hi>Head.</hi> It is said in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with wine, but be filled with the spirit.</hi> It seems they that have the <hi>spirit</hi> of strong Liquors intoxicating of them, cannot be filled with the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God: But this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that another <hi>Spirit,</hi> a wicked <hi>Spirit,</hi> must then be filling of them; the <hi>spirits</hi> of strong Drinks, afford a sort of <hi>Pabulum</hi> or Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the Devil in the Souls of Men. There are many who drive a trade of Drinking
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93737:23"/> to <hi>excess,</hi> even till they have <hi>disguised</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Many are never well until they feel they have drunk themselves up to some ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>elevations.</hi> I should wrong the very <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine,</hi> if I should say, that these Miscreants made <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uits</hi> of themselves; no, the <hi>Bruits</hi> don't care to be drunk: The Rider, in the well-known Story, could not make his <hi>Horse</hi> drink an <hi>Health,</hi> after the <hi>Beast</hi> counted himself to have drunk enough. But I must rather say of them, they turn themselves into <hi>Devils;</hi> or at least, they turn the <hi>Devils</hi> into themselves; the Devil goes down with every <hi>unlawful Cup,</hi> which they are pouring in. You may observe it among the Barbarous Nations of the World, which the Devil is yet a <hi>God</hi> unto, the Vice of <hi>Drunkenness</hi> must be Epidemical among them, and where the more liquid wayes of Intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can't be had, they have the methods of a <hi>Dry Drunkenness</hi> to serve instead thereof. Why? the Devil knowes that by <hi>Drunkenness</hi> he shall keep a sure and a fast hold of miserable Men. We find in the Gospel, that when the Devil was in poor Creatures, he threw them into the <hi>Fire,</hi> and into the <hi>Water.</hi> 'Tis frequently the condition of drunken Wretches, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that lying Proverb, <hi>A d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed.</hi> Several such Instances have we lately seen; their Sin lay in the abuse of Drinks that would <hi>burn,</hi> and they have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>burnt</hi> with a vengeance for it. Sometimes they are thrown into the <hi>Water,</hi> and there they are <hi>drowned;</hi> and one of them, not very long
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93737:24"/> ago, so remarkably, as that it was in the <hi>Hold</hi> of a Vessel too; a most proper Disaster! For a <hi>drunken</hi> Man is but an Old <hi>English</hi> word for a <hi>drowned</hi> Man. The Devil sees that if he can make Men <hi>drunk,</hi> he can do what he will with them; they will then stick at nothing that he shall urge them to; as in the memorable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story recited by <hi>Lonicerus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have a Drink that has been called <hi>Kill-Devil;</hi> but old Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> truly said, it might rather be called, <hi>Kill Men for the Devil.</hi> It is indeed a thing that every day does <hi>fill Men with the Devil.</hi> Behold more to whom we may say, <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine Heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Devil</hi> has filled the Heart, when <hi>Falshood</hi> is filling of it. It is the word of Truth in <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>The Devil is a Lyar, and the Father of it.</hi> Even so, <hi>The Devil is a Lyar, and the filler of such.</hi> There are those that will tell a Lye for the sake of some secular trivial advantage; perhaps in Buying and Selling they will multiply <hi>Lies</hi> to serve their little Bargains. This renders Men like our <hi>Ananias</hi> here; when the Man was catched in a <hi>Cheat,</hi> sayes the Apostle, <hi>Man, Satan has been filling that false Heart of thine.</hi> There are those will <hi>belye</hi> their Neighbours; that will defame, reproach, and either make or spread very <hi>false</hi> Reports about the Country. 'Tis a <hi>Diabolism</hi> which they are herein guilty of. This is to be just like the <hi>Devil,</hi> who uses to slander the Children of Men before the Lord. We read in the Scripture, about, <hi>A City full of Lyes;</hi> and you may be sure it was then, <hi>A City full of Devils</hi> too.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93737:24"/> When the People of God were honestly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the <hi>Church-work,</hi> which the King had hitherto countenanced, a company of ill-advised Men sent home their lying <hi>Address<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, Petitions</hi> and <hi>Letters</hi> against them to obstruct them in it; their words were, <hi>Thy Servants, the Men on this side the water,</hi> inform, <hi>That they are building a rebellious and a bad City; and if the City be built, it will endamage the Revenue of the Kings.</hi> Who do you suppose inspired those <hi>false Libellers?</hi> Doubtless, it must be that Spirit who is called, <hi>The accuser of the Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, There are those that are very false in their <hi>Promises;</hi> they'll promise you to do a <hi>Work▪</hi> or pay a <hi>Debt,</hi> most certainly within such a time; but no heed is to be given unto any thing they say; 'tis affirmed, that some <hi>Church-Members</hi> are very scandalous for this Iniquity. Indeed! But let them for all their high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, hear who their <hi>Leader</hi> is. In this thing they follow the <hi>Devil,</hi> who made once a large <hi>promise</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>All this will I do for thee;</hi> but never was a syllable of it like to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. These People serve their Neighbours just as the <hi>Devils</hi> do the <hi>Witches,</hi> in the <hi>promises</hi> that they make unto them, Who do you think <hi>fills</hi> them all the while?</p>
                  <p>Finally, There are those that are very false in their <hi>pretences</hi> too; they'll speak very fair, and be your most <hi>Humble Servants;</hi> but at the same time the Rule you must have in treating with them, is, <hi>When they speak fair, believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> them not, for there are seven abominations in their Hearts;</hi> and for that very cause we may add,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93737:25"/>
                     <hi>There are seven Devils in those Hearts of these.</hi> A <hi>Judas</hi> comes and cringes, and kisses, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, When the <hi>Mouth</hi> is full of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> cannot but be so too. It is said in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.34. <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</hi> Would we understand what the <hi>Heart</hi> is <hi>filled</hi> with? it will be seen at the <hi>Mouth.</hi> A <hi>fur</hi> and a <hi>filth</hi> upon the <hi>Tongue</hi> will discover the inward <hi>Fevers</hi> of the Soul. We read concerning, <hi>A Tongue set on fire of Hell.</hi> There are <hi>Tongues</hi> that are full of Railing, full of Cursing, full of Ribaldry and Obscenity: Why, 'tis the <hi>Devil</hi> that sets <hi>Fire</hi> to those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious <hi>Tongues;</hi> but it their <hi>Hearts</hi> had not first been full of the Devil, there would not be so much <hi>Hell</hi> belch'd out of their <hi>Mouths.</hi> There are Tongues that will tear and rend the Blessed Name of God, with whole volleyes of cruel <hi>Oaths;</hi> 'tis because they are charged full of the <hi>Devil,</hi> that they go off at such a furious rate. And the same <hi>Tongues</hi> usually have the Name of the <hi>Devil</hi> into all affairs; if any thing be amiss, they say, <hi>What? the Devil ails it?</hi> I Answer them, 'Tis the <hi>Devil</hi> that <hi>ails you,</hi> the thing is otherwise well enough: If any thing vex them, they wish, <hi>The Devil take it!</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer them, The Devil has <hi>taken you</hi> already, or you had never spoken so. Here are yet
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93737:25"/> others to whom we say, <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, When the Man is full of <hi>mischief,</hi> you may be sure the Heart is full of the <hi>Devil.</hi> It was a smart speech of the Apostle to a Man that would have hindered another from turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.10. <hi>O full of all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, thou child of the devil.</hi> Truly such a <hi>Child of the Devil</hi> must needs be <hi>full of the Devil.</hi> There are those that have an extream delight in doing <hi>mischief</hi> to those that are about them; those that love to <hi>sow discords,</hi> to <hi>make brangles,</hi> to <hi>multiply disorders;</hi> it is a <hi>sport</hi> unto them to imbroil Humane Affairs; but these <hi>Fools</hi> are the <hi>Tools</hi> of the Devil in such things as these. Above all, there are those that stab and wound the <hi>Souls</hi> of their unhappy Neighbours; that <hi>poyson</hi> the Souls of their Neighbours with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices against the Truths, and the Ways, and the Servants of the Living God; that <hi>entice</hi> the Souls of their Neighbours into those companies and practices, which will infallibly undo them for ever. These <hi>Agents</hi> of the Devil can't be empty of him. The Devil is the chief <hi>Tempter</hi> of the World; all you little <hi>Tempters</hi> are but his under-Officers; and it is <hi>he</hi> that <hi>fills</hi> you and <hi>fits</hi> you for that piece of mischief. But some there are that advance to such a measure of mischief, as to attempt no less than the very <hi>murder</hi> of themselves. When persons fall into <hi>discontent,</hi> and are not able to bear the <hi>sorrows</hi> or <hi>terrors</hi> of their Souls; or when they have <hi>provoked God</hi> by some extraordinary Impieties and Iniquities, it is no rare thing for them to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93737:26"/> fall thus far into the <hi>Devils</hi> hands. <hi>Self-murder</hi> is a prodigious piece of <hi>self-mischief;</hi> and it is therewithal, a sort of <hi>Revenge</hi> upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God himself. None but an Heart <hi>full</hi> of the Devil will attempt such a nefandous wickedness: Indeed you may see much of the <hi>Devil</hi> in it, by the assistance which the <hi>Devil</hi> himself gives to many unnatural <hi>self-executions;</hi> one would think it impossible to kill a Man by such means as many wretched Creatures kill themselves withal; but when once they have begun, the Devil, who is the <hi>Angel of Death,</hi> immediately makes them uncapable to desist. Behold, those monsters to whom it might be said, <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Malignity,</hi> especially when accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>Apostacy,</hi> proclaims that the <hi>Devil</hi> has <hi>filled</hi> the Heart of a mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

What then is done by those that have <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> continually broiling in their Hearts? 'Tis the crime of many; and they bestow the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They can't endure <hi>Holiness,</hi> nor those Principles, nor those Ministers, that would promote much of <hi>Holiness</hi> in the World. This is not because the <hi>Devil</hi> is a stranger to the Hearts of those evil Men. Said the Devil once unto our Lord. <hi>What have I to do with thee, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, when they can't bear what has a stamp
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93737:26"/> of <hi>Holiness</hi> upon it; but make their clamours and outcries thereupon immediately. A Man that made some Figure once, passing a Censure upon an Holy Person, had so little Grace and Wit, as to say, <hi>That Man is so like to God, that I cannot endure him.</hi> There spoke now a <hi>Devil incarnate.</hi> Alas, there are Men that can't endure what has much of God and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> attending of it; a <hi>Government</hi> that shall be all for <hi>Holiness,</hi> a <hi>Ministry</hi> that shall be all for <hi>Holiness,</hi> is a terrible eye-sore to these evil Men. Why, 'tis a black Mark of <hi>the Devil in the heart,</hi> which those people wear upon them. But it is more dreadfully <hi>symptomatical,</hi> if these have heretofore been better affected and inclined. The Devil is the first and chief <hi>Apostate</hi> in the World; and it's his being in their Hearts that renders others herein like unto him. It is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of such <hi>Apostates</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. <hi>The unclean spirit goes and takes with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there.</hi> Many a Man that once had his Heart so <hi>swept,</hi> as that he could <hi>weep</hi> at a Sermon, and he had a great kindne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s for the Churches of God; this Man loses all the savours of Heaven that once were upon the Soul of him; he comes to despise and reproach the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> to sit and flout and scoff in the most <hi>serious Ordinances,</hi> to entertain a desperate <hi>antipathy</hi> against what is <hi>holy, and just, and good.</hi> Now the <hi>Devil</hi> is gone into the Heart of that Man, with <hi>seven</hi> more of his Crue, to <hi>dwell</hi> there for ever. Go toll the <hi>passing Bell</hi> for the Soul of that Man; there is hardly any hope of his recovery.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93737:27"/>
                  <p>If any one of all these Characters be found upon any of us, let them take the <hi>warning,</hi> which thereupon belongs unto them: Let them know, that they are going on to all manner of <hi>wickedness</hi> and <hi>misery.</hi> Stop, Sinner, stop; O make a stand. What can you think will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, if you permit the Devil to <hi>fill</hi> you any more?

May all young People be particularly admonished against all delays of turning to the Lord. It will be an easier thing for you <hi>now</hi> to shake off the Chains of the Devil upon you, than it will be afterwards. We read of one, from whom it was an hard thing to get the Devil out; and what was the Reason of it? We read in <hi>Mark</hi> 9.21. <hi>How long ago is it since this came unto him? And he said, of a child.</hi> Alas, there is not one unreg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Child</hi> in this Assembly, but it may be said, <hi>Satan has filled the Heart of that Child.</hi> But if you would <hi>now</hi> turn from all Sin, while you are <hi>Children,</hi> it will be unspeakably less trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to get out of the Devils clutches, than it can be afterwards. Let all <hi>young</hi> People then cry to God immediately, that he would bestow a Regeneration on them. <hi>David</hi> rescues <hi>Lambs</hi> from the <hi>Lion.</hi> And yet let not the oldest among us all despair of his deliverance, if he now cry to Heaven for it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our <hi>fighting</hi> with the Devil will prevent his <hi>filling</hi> of us. This has the Apostle said unto us in <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> When the Devil follows us, with any of his Temptations, reject them as the Pious <hi>Joseph</hi> did, <hi>How shall I do this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and sin against God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The way to encounter any Temptations of the Devil, is to oppose the <hi>Word</hi> of God unto them. The Advice proper for us, is that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Take the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</hi> Behold, a <hi>Sword</hi> for us to combate and conquer all the Devils in Hell withal; I may say of that Sword, as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliahs, There is none like it.</hi> When the Devil assaulted our Saviour with his Temptations, he replyed upon him. <hi>It is written! It is written!</hi> Thus, when the Devil with his Temptations,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93737:28"/> would get into our Hearts, let us tell him what is <hi>written</hi> in the Commandments, the Promises, the Threatnings of the Blessed God. <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was not more frighted at the <hi>Hand-writing</hi> on the <hi>Wall,</hi> than the Devil is at what is <hi>written</hi> in the Word of God, when 'tis laid before him. I remember, <hi>Athanasius,</hi> I think 'tis, reports, that in his time, the Devils in some that were possessed, could not bear to hear that Scripture in <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.1. <hi>Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered.</hi> Why, the <hi>whole Bible</hi> is of a like efficacy to drive the Devil from us. Learn to fence with a <hi>Text of Scripture,</hi> against all the Passes which the Devil is making at us; he'll not be able to close in with us, while we keep the Point of this <hi>two edged Sword</hi> upon him. This is that <hi>strong Sword of the Lord,</hi> which will <hi>plague Leviathan the cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We must <hi>keep</hi> our Hearts, if we would not have the Devil to <hi>fill</hi> our Hearts. We have this among the Oracles of Wisdom, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi> It is by <hi>watchfulness</hi> that we best secure our Hearts from the Invasions and Incroachments of a busie Devil. We should alwayes be <hi>suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> lest the Devil be circumventing of us with some of his Temptations; and we should alwayes be as jealous about our own Hearts, as <hi>Job</hi> was about the Hearts of his unwary Children.</p>
                  <p>We should keep a constant <hi>guard</hi> upon our selves; and be among those <hi>blessed</hi> ones, of whom 'tis said, <hi>They fear always.</hi> 'Twas said
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93737:29"/> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41, <hi>Watch, that ye enter not into temptation.</hi> Even so, to be <hi>watchful,</hi> will keep <hi>Temptation</hi> from entering into us. I pray then, keep alwayes <hi>awake.</hi> 'Tis possible, that some of you are in circumstances peculiarly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of you to Temptations. You have laid aside something of that <hi>intimate Communion</hi> with God, which you have heretofore been used unto; you are grown <hi>formal, sleighty, weary</hi> in your Devotions; you are plunged over Head and Ears into the <hi>delights,</hi> or <hi>hurries,</hi> or <hi>troubles</hi> of the World; I must now cry to you, as 'twas cryed unto <hi>Sampson</hi> of old, <hi>The Philistines ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'TIS an Observation which has been sometimes made for the incouragement of serious Devotions, <hi>That either Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will make Men leave Sinning, or Sinning will make Men leave Praying.</hi> That there is an <hi>excess</hi> of <hi>Sinning</hi> among us, is a thing for which we have both God and Man testifying against us; 'tis that which particularly awakens the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Heaven to <hi>cry aloud, and not spare, but lift up our voice like a trumpet.</hi> And a <hi>defect</hi> of <hi>Praying</hi> among us, is doubtless to be assigned as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93737:31"/> one cause of our multiplyed abominations; 'tis not only <hi>it self</hi> an inexcusable Fault, but also 'tis the <hi>original</hi> of those many other Crimes which we are exposed unto the Vengeance of Heaven by.

            <p>The great Article in the description of such woful Sinners is, their <hi>Atheism;</hi> 'tis possible, they dare not <hi>say</hi> with their <hi>Mouths, There is no God:</hi> Humane Society would not endure an Assertion so criminal and odious; and the most Bruitish Atheist will, as <hi>Calvin</hi> relates of one in a sudden distress, cry out, <hi>O God, help me!</hi> Nor can they <hi>think</hi> with their <hi>Hearts, There is no God:</hi> No, 'tis ingraven there with indelible Impressions; I cannot find that all Histories report of more than twenty persons that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto perfect Atheism; yea, I suppose I may affirm, <hi>There never was a Man, who had a firm and long perswasion, that there was no God,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93737:32"/> without vehement suspicions to the contrary.</hi> But they say in their <hi>Hearts, There is no God;</hi> it is but a Practical Atheism, that they are guilty of; and this Verse gives us two demonstrations of it; they are both <hi>injurious</hi> to Men, and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious</hi> to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They eat up the People of God as they eat bread.</hi> They destroy the People of God with <hi>open mouth;</hi> and they do it with as little <hi>remorse,</hi> they do it with as much <hi>fury</hi> and as much <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> as they can eat a meal when they are hungry. Such <hi>Canibals</hi> do the People of God often meet withal!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They have not called upon God.</hi> They live without <hi>Prayer</hi> from day to day. <hi>Prayer</hi> is first a matter of meer <hi>form,</hi> and it quickly becomes a matter of pure <hi>scorn</hi> to such ungodly wretches.</p>
            <p>You may behold in this Verse; First, <hi>A que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> by way of <hi>Complaint: Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread?</hi> It is the note of one, that the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist here does not so much <hi>quaerere</hi> as <hi>queri;</hi> not so much <hi>inquire</hi> as <hi>complain.</hi> A <hi>wicked folly</hi> is here supposed in all the Persecutors of the Church. But wherein does that appear? Why, Secondly, We have an Answer hereunto, <hi>They have not called upon God.</hi> q. d. This puts it out of doubt, that they are the <hi>workers</hi> of <hi>iniquity</hi> which <hi>have no knowledge in them.</hi> In the former mention of this passage, the Name of <hi>Jehovah</hi> was used, which represents God as the Author of <hi>Being;</hi> in this 'tis the Name of <hi>Elohim,</hi> which represents God as the Author of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> It intimates that they who <hi>call not upon

                  <p>A true <hi>Prayer</hi> is a calling upon God in Christ, for Mercy to be in his <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> bestowed upon us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> For the <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer, it is, <hi>God in Christ.</hi> It is a vile, a detestable, an execrable <hi>Idolatry</hi> to pray unto any other besides the Eternal God. For to <hi>pray,</hi> is to repair unto the <hi>first cause,</hi> for help in our difficulties. An Holy <hi>Daniel,</hi> with his three worthy <hi>Companions,</hi> bravely chose to undergo very terrible Deaths, rather than to commit that Iniquity. It is an Oracle which the chief Devil of Hell once trembled at, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Thou shalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> None but the <hi>Hearer</hi> of Prayer can without infinite absurdity be made the <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer. The <hi>Hearer</hi> of Prayer must needs be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93737:33"/> an <hi>Omnipresent</hi> one; he must be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive millions of persons in millions of places, at once pouring out their Groans unto him. And the <hi>Hearer</hi> of Prayer must needs be an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> one; he must be able to gratifie and accomplish the vast wishes of Immortal Souls, which inlarge themselves like the very Heavens. Now none besides the Lord our God, is thus <hi>Omnipresent</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent;</hi> it is his Title in <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.2. <hi>O thou that hearest prayer.</hi> But the great God may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed by sinful Men, but in, and by, and through Jesus Christ; our Blessed Jesus has told us in <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the way, none comes to the Father, but by me.</hi> 'Tis through a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> that God will be conversed withal; and let Popery teach what it will, <hi>There is but one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for us, even the Man Christ Jesus.</hi> As <hi>Joseph</hi> said unto those in <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.5. <hi>You shall not see my face, except your brother be with you;</hi> so does our God say unto us, <hi>You shall not seek my face unless you bring your Saviour with you.</hi> When we pray, it must be with an Eye to the <hi>satisfaction</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ. As <hi>Jonah</hi> said in his Prayer, in <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.4. <hi>I will look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thy holy temple;</hi> thus in our Prayers, we must exercise a dependance on the Lord Jesus Christ, the Antitype of the Temple, for our acceptance with the Father. And when we pray, it must be with an eye to the <hi>intercession</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ; that is, the Incense which we must have our Prayers perfumed withal, that they may not be ungrateful unto God; as we read in <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.4. <hi>The smoke of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93737:33"/> the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God, out of the Angels hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>Nature</hi> of Prayer, 'tis a <hi>call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God.</hi> A <hi>Desire</hi> is that in which begins the Formation of a <hi>Prayer;</hi> but the business of <hi>Prayer</hi> is to present our <hi>Desire</hi> before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; the Apostle calls <hi>Prayer,</hi> in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. <hi>A making known of our requests unto God.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Prayer</hi> only forms these Requests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Thoughts;</hi> thus that Invitation to <hi>Prayer,</hi> in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.41. <hi>Let us lift up our hearts unto God in the heavens.</hi> There are in it the secret outgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Will</hi> unto God for his Blessing, and perhaps <hi>unutterable groans.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Prayer</hi> also forms the Requests into <hi>Words;</hi> as we are advised in <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Take to your selves words.</hi> The Arrowes are shot up to Heaven by the Bow of the <hi>Tongue.</hi> But in what manner does a Right Prayer present our <hi>Desires</hi> unto God? It is with a <hi>calling</hi> upon him. <hi>Prayer</hi> is thus deciphered in <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59 'tis, <hi>A Calling.</hi> And the Almighty God is therein <hi>call'd</hi> upon. This is a term used for <hi>Prayer,</hi> I think, more than twenty times in the Book of God. And hence also, <hi>Prayer</hi> is denominated very frequently, <hi>A crying to the Lord;</hi> thus we read about, <hi>The cry of the Righteous;</hi> and it is said in <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.6. <hi>This poor man cryed unto the Lord.</hi> This is the difference between <hi>right Prayer,</hi> and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth short of it. In False Prayers Men <hi>comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but in Right ones, they <hi>clamour.</hi> A <hi>Call</hi> is an earnest Request; a <hi>Call</hi> is a Request with much fervency, with some agony, and coming
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93737:34"/> from a sense of deep distress. When a Man truly <hi>Prayes,</hi> he does not <hi>sport</hi> in it, or <hi>scoff</hi> in it; but according to that in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17. <hi>He prayes in Prayer.</hi> There is a <hi>striving in Prayer,</hi> there is a <hi>wrestling in Prayer,</hi> there is a <hi>labouring Prayer,</hi> where Prayer is duely made. Indeed the <hi>Call</hi> of a Right Prayer is not so much in the <hi>Voice</hi> of it, as in the <hi>Grace</hi> of it. We read not that <hi>Moses</hi> audibly uttered a syllable, when yet the Lord said in <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Wherefore cryest thou unto me?</hi> Warm and strong Affections make a <hi>cry</hi> in that thing which is worthy to be called, <hi>A Prayer;</hi> 'tis a thing beyond meer <hi>Lip-labour</hi> or <hi>Lung-labour;</hi> 'tis not the meer <hi>saying of Prayers,</hi> that is of any account with that God, who if he be not served in <hi>Spirit,</hi> counts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self not served in <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the <hi>matter</hi> of Prayer, it is, <hi>Mercy to be obtained as the Lord shall please.</hi> What is to be the Petition of our Prayers? In short, it is that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.1. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God.</hi> And the particular <hi>Mercies</hi> which our Prayers must insist upon, are those which the Word of God recommends unto us. We are told in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.14. <hi>If we ask any thing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God, he heareth us.</hi> Our Prayers must be alwayes answerable to the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will</hi> of God; the Will of Gods <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> hath set the bounds of our Prayers, and said, <hi>Hitherto shall ye go, and no further.</hi> Of every <hi>command</hi> there, it should be our Prayer, <hi>Lord, help me to keep it;</hi> of every Promise, <hi>Lord, give me to find it;</hi> of every Threatning, <hi>Lord, give me to shun it:</hi> In short, The <hi>Lords Prayer</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:93737:34"/> is to be the <hi>Directory</hi> of all <hi>our Prayers.</hi> But our Prayers must also be with a submission to the <hi>secret Will</hi> of God; the <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of Mercies, it must be left unto the Will of Gods <hi>purpose</hi> to order that. Our Language in our Prayer should be, <hi>Let God have mercy on me when he will; it is not for me to know the time:</hi> Our Language is to be, <hi>Let God have mercy on me, how he will: his way is alwayes best:</hi> It is to be, <hi>Let God proportion his mercy to me, according to his pleasure; I may not limit the holy one of Israel.</hi> This is a true Prayer. But now,</p>

                  <p>It is a <hi>wicked folly</hi> to live without such Prayer unto the Eternal God. Now to evince this, let these things be pondered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> To live without <hi>Prayer</hi> is a piece of cursed <hi>Atheism;</hi> no easier a Name than <hi>that</hi> is to be put upon it. He that lives without Prayer, denies or disputes the very <hi>Being</hi> of a God. Thus we find concerning the Atheist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>He hath said in his heart, there is no God;</hi> and it quickly follows, <hi>They call not upon the Lord.</hi> If we grant this, That <hi>God</hi> is, the next thing to be granted, is, <hi>He is diligently to be sought unto.</hi> The Apostle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. makes those two Principles to stand as immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and inseparable as the very Pillars of Heaven. To live without <hi>Prayer,</hi> is to live as if there were no Soul, no Hell, no God. It
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93737:35"/> is said in <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The wicked will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts:</hi> Or, as it may be rendered, <hi>All his thoughts are, that there is no God.</hi> He that withholds this piece of <hi>Natural Worship</hi> from God, e'en sayes, <hi>I will have no God at all.</hi> But what a <hi>wicked Folly</hi> is this? 'Tis an Impiety beyond what the blackest and the fiercest of all the Devils in Hell ever yet arrived unto. All the Works both of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> are every one of them the <hi>Heralds of a Deity;</hi> the Atheist has every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Universe, together with the <hi>consent of Nations,</hi> to cry out upon him; and there is nothing in the World, but what serves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found that <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>live without Prayer</hi> is to disobey and contradict the <hi>Command</hi> of the Great God. The God of Heaven is the Governour of the World; he is the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the Most High Monarch over all; and he has required this Homage from all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, <hi>That we pray unto him.</hi> 'Tis the Edict of Heaven in 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceasing.</hi> This is indeed a main thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>First Commandment</hi> of the Law; when 'tis said, <hi>Thou shalt have the Lord for thy God,</hi> a main thing therein intended is, <hi>Thou shalt make thy Prayers unto the God of Heaven.</hi> 'Tis a thing which the Command of God has, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception or exemption, enjoined upon all the World. As for <hi>good</hi> Men; our Lord said unto his Disciples, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Pray ye.</hi> As for <hi>ill</hi> Men too; 'twas said unto such an one, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22. <hi>Pray to God.</hi> Now 'tis a <hi>wicked
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93737:35"/> Folly</hi> to rebel against the Voice of God. All his <hi>Commandments</hi> are <hi>holy, and just, and good;</hi> and it is a madness for us to dare his Righteous and his Terrible Vengeance, by speaking like those Miscreants of old, <hi>As for the word spoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What Man alive is there, who has not manifold <hi>occasions</hi> of <hi>calling upon the Lord?</hi> Poor Man is a depending sort of thing; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist <hi>of</hi> and <hi>from,</hi> as he may not <hi>for</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He cannot make a <hi>shift</hi> without God, and therefore 'tis a <hi>wicked Folly</hi> for him to live without <hi>Prayer</hi> unto God. It was the insolent speech of <hi>Pilate,</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 19.10. <hi>Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power over thee?</hi> But the Glorious God may speak after that rate unto every one of us: <hi>What? Speakest thou not unto me? Shall not I have a Prayer from thee, when I have such power over thee? Knowest thou not, that in me thou livest, thou movest, thou hast thy Being. Knowest thou not that thou art every moment in danger of my Damning thee for thy Disobedience?</hi> Truly every Soul of us, has many <hi>Sins</hi> to be pardoned, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>wants</hi> to be supplyed, many <hi>woes</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated; we are strangely stupid and sottish, 'tis a <hi>dumb Devil</hi> that has possession of us, if we go not unto God by Prayer in such unhappy circumstances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is no <hi>Godly Man</hi> that can live without <hi>Prayer,</hi> unto the God that made him. Sayes the Psalmist, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Every one that is godly shall pray unto thee.</hi> A <hi>Godly</hi> Man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93737:36"/> a <hi>praying</hi> Man. A Man does do soone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is matter of reprehension, that <hi>secret Prayer</hi> is not regarded by many of us. It is the <hi>Command</hi> of our Lord, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Pray in thy closet;</hi> and it was his own <hi>custom</hi> according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>To depart into a solitary place,</hi> that he might be <hi>praying</hi> there.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93737:39"/> prayers</hi> are called for. It may prove a perillous and a pernicious thing, to omit but one <hi>secret prayer;</hi> it was bitterly bewailed by <hi>Origen</hi> of old, that the day whereon he fell into the soul scandal that cost him such an Ocean of Tears and Shame, was a day wherein <hi>secret Prayer</hi> had been passed over with him. Sayes our Lord, <hi>Pray to thy Father which is in secret:</hi> It seems they who duely <hi>pray in secret</hi> may call God their <hi>Father;</hi> did the Lord often see you, like <hi>Nathanael,</hi> under the Fig tree, he would say of you, as in <hi>John</hi> 1.47. <hi>Behold, an Israelite indeed!</hi> But alas, he rarely sees you there. The <hi>secret Prayers</hi> of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Field, preserved all that belonged unto him; the <hi>secret prayers</hi> of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> carried on all his weighty Businesses at the Court; the <hi>secret Prayers</hi> of <hi>Hannath</hi> begg'd of God but for <hi>one Son,</hi> and he gave her six times as much as she asked of him; the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayers</hi> of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> prevented his falling as a Sacrifice to unreasonable Men; and the <hi>secret prayers</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi> in the Belcony, fetched into his holy Soul, as much of Heaven as ever he could hold. But these are things which you are meer strangers unto: O that you were sensible of the <hi>wicked Folly</hi> in your being so!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis matter of reprehension, that <hi>private Prayer</hi> is not attended by many of us. The Apostle sayes to <hi>Masters</hi> of Families in <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Continue in prayer;</hi> alluding to the <hi>continual offering</hi> under the Law of old. But how many <hi>Masters</hi> do rob God of this <hi>Daily Sacrifice?</hi> They do not bring it both <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> to him. They pretend they have

They forget the Word of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed.</hi> And the Prayerless Masters of <hi>Vessels</hi> as well as of <hi>Houses,</hi> are deeply concerned in this Admonition. Vain Men, how little are you like <hi>Joshua,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in <hi>chap</hi> 24.15. <hi>As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</hi> Were there much <hi>Prayer</hi> constantly going in your Houses, God would bless them, as he did the House of <hi>Obed-edom,</hi> when the Ark was there.

We may make that confession in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. <hi>All this evil is come upon us▪ yet have we not made our prayer before the Lord our God.</hi> How backward have we been to <hi>Fasting</hi> under our complicated Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and Calamities? and when we do <hi>Fast,</hi> is it with <hi>such a Fast as the Lord has chosen?</hi> Do not we <hi>Fast</hi> with our <hi>Ornaments</hi> upon us? Or without any <hi>Affliction</hi> in our <hi>Abstinence?</hi> And how little <hi>Fasting</hi> is there of Christians in <hi>retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> before the Lord? <hi>Nehemiah</hi> would not undertake a weighty matter, before he had spent a <hi>whole day</hi> in a retired Fellowship with God. But how common is it for us to change our <hi>Conditions,</hi> to begin our <hi>Voyages,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach our <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and do many more such important things, without such preparations?

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It were well if we were more frequent and more serious in our <hi>Ejaculatory Prayers.</hi> These are a sort of <hi>prayers</hi> which our Blessed Jesus was much used unto; and we read of a great Man in <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4. that he would not answer a Question of any Concernment, without such a <hi>prayer.</hi> Indeed, there are profane <hi>Ejaculations</hi> proceeding from the mouths of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; with very frothy frames, they lard all their Discourses with an, <hi>O Lord,</hi> and <hi>O Lord, bless me!</hi> A common Swearer is but the Elder Brother of them who thus <hi>take the Name of God in vain.</hi> But instead thereof, we should be often sending up our Ejaculatory Prayers, both <hi>Hosannahs</hi> and <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> both <hi>Petitions</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> from our affected Souls unto the Lord. A besieged City have before now tyed their Letters unto Arrows, and shot them over the Heads of their <hi>Adversaries,</hi> into the Hands of their <hi>Auxiliaries.</hi> Thus, when we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged and beset never so much with the incumbrances of the World, yet we should be often in a Day lifting up our Hearts unto <hi>God who dwelleth in the Heavens.</hi> But how few are there that thus keep in their Souls a <hi>continual Feast?</hi> As we are walking the Streets with our Minds quite empty of all other things, how rarely have we any devout <hi>Ejaculations</hi> in them, for a Blessing on themselves, or on them that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes? Yea, when the Hearers of our Lord heard him preach about the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> they presently annexed an <hi>Ejaculation</hi> thereunto, <hi>Lord, Give us this Bread;</hi> but how
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93737:41"/> few Ejaculations has any among us made, since the Sermon this day began? This is also one of our miscarriages. Now let us take the <hi>Reproofs</hi> of God; let our <hi>Prayers</hi> become very vigorous; let us be much in the <hi>Mount,</hi> with our Hands up-lifted there: O tremble at being found among the <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> that <hi>have no knowledge</hi> in them.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93737:43"/> where found in the whole Book of God, than in the words now read unto us.</p>
            <p>Our Blessed Saviour is here discoursing on the dangerous condition wherein the World shall be, just before his coming to the <hi>Judgment</hi> of it. Altho' there are now <hi>revealed</hi> those things about the <hi>day</hi> and <hi>hour</hi> of our Lords, which even our Lord himself, as he was <hi>Man,</hi> was not before his Exaltation so exactly acquainted with; yet the most of Mankind will be <hi>sleepy</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi> towards this great <hi>Evening</hi> of the World, and be surprized by the coming of the Lord. Our Lord therefore with several <hi>Parables</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates the Duty of <hi>Watchfulness</hi> upon us all; and one of those <hi>Parables</hi> is full of those warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that <hi>Church Officers</hi> are peculiarly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in.</p>
            <p>Just before the coming of our Lord, his Church, and especially that part of his Church which he may choose to give the more <hi>special signals</hi> of his coming in, shall be oppressed with a Crue of <hi>Bigotted Clergy men,</hi> who have divers Remarkables in their Character.</p>
            <p>'Tis one thing in their Character, <hi>That they shall begin to smite their Fellow-servants.</hi> If there be a Faithful or Painful Minister, that would labour to promote <hi>serious Godliness</hi> in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ll be sure to persecute him.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93737:43"/> every such Reformer. <hi>They shall begin to smite,]</hi> that is, they shall silence, they shall molest, they shall get one Law after another forged for the Trouble of good Men; and they shall be in a fair way towards hammering of their <hi>Keyes</hi> into <hi>Swords,</hi> and rendering it a <hi>capital</hi> thing to do any service for God; but they shall be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully hindered from carrying the business on so far; they only <hi>begin.</hi> And it is another thing that herewithal goes to make up them Character, <hi>They shall eat and drink with the drinken</hi> It seems, a common <hi>Drunkard</hi> shall find more favour with them, than a pious <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi> they'll censure the most gracious Men alive, that would be found by our Lord Jesus in the punctual and regular observation of those Orders which he has left for his House to be governed with, until he return unto us; but if a Man be a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> a Swearer, a Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, a Whoremaster, then they'll cry, <hi>O he is one of us!</hi> and by no means must such an one be discouraged.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Qui diu toleratur, subito tollitur:</hi> Our Context informs us, that God will bring a sudden <hi>Revolution</hi> upon these unhappy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and it shall be such a <hi>Revolution,</hi> as will give them their <hi>Portion with the Hypocrites;</hi> or, as <hi>Luke</hi> expresses it, <hi>with the unbelievers;</hi> that is, it will <hi>unchurch</hi> them: All their cry was, <hi>The Church, the Church,</hi> but they shall be now cast out of any Interest in the <hi>Church</hi> of God.

                  <p>An <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is one who does pretend <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>but</hi> pretend it. <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> is properly a <hi>counterfeit</hi> of Religion. The <hi>Greek</hi> word for an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> signifies a <hi>Stage-player.</hi> As a <hi>Stage-player</hi> will act the part of a <hi>King,</hi> though he be indeed a <hi>Beggar;</hi> so an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> acts the part of a <hi>Saint,</hi> while he is but a <hi>Sinner</hi> still. The word comes from a Theme, that signifies to <hi>compare;</hi> and a diminutive Particle is prefixed unto it; so that <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> is a thing that may be <hi>compared</hi> unto true Religion; it has a <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and a <hi>shadow</hi> of Religion; but it comes very <hi>short</hi> of the reality; the resemblance is a dull, a faint, an empty thing. Accordingly, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> comes from a Root that signifies, to <hi>tinge,</hi> or <hi>dye</hi> a thing of another Colour than what is Natural. Thus an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> is one that appears not in his <hi>own colours;</hi> there are <hi>false colours</hi> that his Religion is disguised and concealed with Particularly,</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:93737:45"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> In the Religion of an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> his <hi>Graces</hi> want an <hi>Ingredient,</hi> essential to the Graces of true Religion. The utmost attainment of an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> is that in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.28. <hi>Almost thou perswadest me to be a Christian.</hi> As for the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,</hi> his <hi>Faith</hi> is but <hi>Almost</hi> that which is, <hi>The Faith of Gods Elect.</hi> His <hi>Repentance</hi> is but <hi>Almost</hi> that which is, <hi>The Repentance not to be repented of.</hi> His <hi>Holiness</hi> is but <hi>Almost</hi> that which is, <hi>The holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.</hi> They say concerning the Devils, that in <hi>Apparitions</hi> of them, there never is a <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> shape; there is alwayes a <hi>blemish</hi> upon it, by which, as by a <hi>cloven Foot,</hi> it may be distinguished. This may be said about the <hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Hypocrisie;</hi> it has a <hi>shape</hi> of Religion, but there are no <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Graces in it: Some chief <hi>Ingredient</hi> is lacking in them. Our Lord said once to a notable <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.21. <hi>One thing thou lackest.</hi> Here lies the miscarriage of an <hi>Hypocrite!</hi> He may have so much <hi>Faith</hi> as to call the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>The Saviour of the World.</hi> But alas, <hi>One thing thou lackest;</hi> he does not utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all his own Righteousness, and his own Strength, and his own Will, and cordially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord Jesus Christ in every one of <hi>all his Offices.</hi> He may have so much <hi>Repentance,</hi> as to shed whole <hi>Bottles</hi> of Tears for his many Sins; but, <hi>one thing thou lackest;</hi> he has one beloved Sin, one <hi>Herodias,</hi> that he must be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in; there is one <hi>Right Eye,</hi> one <hi>Right Hand,</hi> one Darling Lust, that he can't endure the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of. He may have so much <hi>Holiness,</hi> as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93737:45"/> like him in the Gospel, <hi>to do many things;</hi> but, <hi>one thing thou lackest:</hi> Some one Command of God there is, which he has an irreconcileable prejudice unto; it cannot be said of him, <hi>He counts the precept concerning all things to be right, and he hates every false way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Religion of an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> his <hi>Duties</hi> want a <hi>Principle.</hi> necessary to the Duties of true Religion. The <hi>Hypocrites</hi> case is that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.3. <hi>They took their lamps, and took no oyl with them.</hi> One of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Rabbies describes to us the fashion of the <hi>Lamps</hi> which that Scripture alludes unto. They were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Staves</hi> or <hi>Canes,</hi> to be carried in their hands, having <hi>Vessels</hi> at the top, into which they put both a great <hi>Wiek,</hi> and an <hi>Oyl</hi> to feed it. Now 'tis the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> guise, he may make a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous <hi>blaze</hi> of performances; but he has not an <hi>oyl</hi> within to supply and nourish that short-liv'd <hi>blaze.</hi> Tell me so much as one <hi>external</hi> thing done by a <hi>Believer,</hi> which may not <hi>also</hi> (I don't say <hi>as well</hi>) be done by an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> As how does the Believer <hi>hear</hi> the Word of God, on Sabbath-days, and Lecture-days? Why, we read of some, who are <hi>hearers of the Word,</hi> and yet they <hi>deceive their own selves.</hi> Does the Word of God cause a <hi>Reformation</hi> in the Conversation of a Believer? We read, of them that have <hi>escaped the pollutions of the World, through the knowledge of the Lord,</hi> and yet the <hi>Dogs</hi> return to their <hi>vomit,</hi> the <hi>Swine</hi> return to their <hi>quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire;</hi> they are <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Swine</hi> still! Does the Believer <hi>pray</hi> much, <hi>fast</hi> oft, and <hi>give Alms</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rally? We read of a false <hi>Pharisee</hi> that could
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93737:46"/> say as much, <hi>I Fast twice in the week, and give Tithes of all that I possess.</hi> In a Word, can a Believer <hi>suffer</hi> in the cause of God? We read of some that can <hi>give their Bodies to be burned,</hi> and yet have in them no <hi>Charity</hi> or Sincerity. A <hi>Paul</hi> and an <hi>Alexander</hi> may be fellow-sufferers. What is then the difference? Briefly, <hi>deest ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid intus,</hi> It lies in the <hi>Principle</hi> of all these Duties. <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> don't arrive to this one thing, <hi>The doing of any thing purely out of respect unto the blessed God.</hi> What is done by the Hypocrite, either he does it out of <hi>Custom;</hi> he is a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> for the same cause that another is a <hi>Jew,</hi> or a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Papist;</hi> and he <hi>goes to Church</hi> (as he calls it) upon the very same account with his <hi>Dog</hi> that follows him. Or else, he does it out of <hi>terror;</hi> all his Resolutions for God, are like the Vowes that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made, when the Thunders of Heaven rumbled over him: The fear of Death or <hi>Shame</hi> is the cause of all his Goodness. Or lastly, He does it out of <hi>design.</hi> He undertakes no good thing without some <hi>Earthly Byas</hi> upon his undertaking. It is with him, as in <hi>Matth</hi> 6.2. he does, <hi>to be seen of men.</hi> An Hypocrite is a <hi>Man-pleaser.</hi> 'Tis to serve some Secular Interest, that he does list himself among the People of God; he would quickly desert them, if danger appeared; as <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> they say, will run out of a fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hoase. There is this failing in the most splendid and glorious Actions of an Hypocrite, <hi>Have ye done it unto me, even unto me, saith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:93737:46"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Hypocrite is not <hi>secretly,</hi> that which he <hi>openly</hi> seems to be. Our Lord has notably touch'd upon this quality of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23, 28. <hi>He makes clean the out-side of the platter: He is like one of the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> whited and painted every Spring; <hi>but within, he is full of hypocrisie and iniquity.</hi> If the Hypocrite can approve himself <hi>World-ward,</hi> he is enough; to approve himself <hi>God-ward,</hi> is not the most sollicitous of his cares. He will keep some <hi>guard</hi> upon his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Walks,</hi> but at the same time it may be said, <hi>How long shall thy vain thoughts l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dge within thee?</hi> He takes little pains to cleanse his <hi>Heart</hi> of such proud, revengeful, envious and lascivious <hi>thoughts,</hi> as render that Heart of his a noysome Dunghil before the Lord. It is the description of an Hypocrite, in <hi>Job</hi> 36.13. he is <hi>an hyyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in heart.</hi> Indeed that is the property of an Hypocrite, <hi>God shall have any thing but the heart of him.</hi> You may see it especially in his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Exercises; he will be much in such Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, but he has not his <hi>Heart</hi> prepared for, nor his <hi>Heart</hi> affected in, those Exercises. He will do <hi>good Works</hi> every day, but is not studious to have <hi>good frames</hi> in the doing of them. God may say, <hi>This people draw near me with their mouth, but have removed their heart far from me.</hi> To instance in one Sacred Exercise; there is that of <hi>Prayer.</hi> An Hypocrites Prayer, 'tis more by <hi>Art</hi> than by <hi>Heart;</hi> he is very nice about the <hi>Expressions</hi> on his Tongue, but wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless about the <hi>Impressions</hi> on his Heart, when he stands before the Lord. And hence also the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93737:47"/> Hypocrite is very forward upon <hi>publick</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, but about <hi>private</hi> ones, he is as remiss as can be; he is very large and full, as to what is to be done at a <hi>Meeting;</hi> but follow him home to his <hi>Closet,</hi> and you shall find small or no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Almighty there. But now,</p>

               <div n="2" type="proposition">

                  <p>Very <hi>miserable</hi> will be the <hi>portion</hi> of such an Hypocrite. Indeed, some Hypocrisie there is in the best Men alive: Hypocrisie is a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof we may speak, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can say, I have made my heart clean?</hi> But for a Man to have so much Hypocrisie, to be so much under the power and reign of Hypocrisie, as may denominate him an Hypocrite before the Lord; O 'tis impossible to declare the <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> that such a Man thereby plunges his own woful Soul into! I remember that when the Queen of <hi>Israel</hi> presented her self before the Prophet in a <hi>disguise,</hi> the good Man that heard of her coming, said in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Come thou wife of Jeroboam, why feignest thou thy self to be another? I am sent unto thee with heavy tidings.</hi> If there be any Hypocrite now among us [and it is well if there been 't!] sitting under the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise</hi> of a fair Profession, I must in like sort say unto him, <hi>Come, thou dissembler, I am sent unto thee with heavy tidings from the Lord.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The portion of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is, <hi>To be cut asunder.</hi> Perhaps he esteems himself safe, and sayes with <hi>Agag, The bitterness of Death is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93737:47"/> past;</hi> but God comes upon him, and like <hi>Agag,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.33. he is <hi>hewn to pieces before the Lord.</hi> Forlorn Creature! <hi>He</hi> made a <hi>division</hi> between God and the World, a <hi>division</hi> between God and a Lust; <hi>something</hi> he gave to God, but <hi>something</hi> the World and a Lust laid claim unto; and now God will make a <hi>division</hi> upon <hi>him</hi> for ever. It was of old the manner to handle some that were counted enormous Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors at such a rate, as <hi>cutting them asunder:</hi> It is reckoned among the usual Torments, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. <hi>They were sawn asunder.</hi> It was of old, and it still is, the usage, for <hi>Traitors</hi> to be thus dealt withal. The <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is a <hi>Traitor</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> he takes an <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to the Lord Jesus Christ, and is listed under the Banner, and for the Service of that Holy Lord; but he is indeed one of the Devils Party all the while. Now, the Great God will proceed against the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> as guilty of an <hi>High Treason</hi> against his Eternal Majesty. But this is not all that is in the <hi>cutting asunder</hi> of the Hypocrite referred unto. <hi>Sacrifices</hi> did use to be thus handled in the former Ages; thus, besides what is recorded concerning the like act of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> we find in <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.18. <hi>They cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> in their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> at the making of their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants;</hi> the scope of which Rite was, <hi>q. d. Discindantur ejus membra, &amp; fiat sicut pecus istuct, qui juramentum violaverit.</hi> Why, the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is one that has made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with God; but it may be said of such a Man, <hi>His heart was not right with God, neither was he stedfast in his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93737:48"/> covenant.</hi> Hence what follows but this? The Righteous and Jealous God will make a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of this wretched Hypocrite; he shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the burning and furious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Omnipotent God. He has <hi>broke</hi> his Covenant; and now the vindictive Justice of God will <hi>break</hi> him <hi>asunder</hi> for it; or as it is expressed in <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.22. <hi>I will tear you to pieces, and there shall be none to deliver you.</hi> But when shall the Hypocrite thus be <hi>cut asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi> It shall be at least when he comes to <hi>dye,</hi> and leave the World. The sharp <hi>scythe</hi> of Death will one day <hi>cut asunder</hi> the Hypocrite, so that the Body and the Spirit of the Man shall never have one comfortable hour together any more. The Curse which was denounced upon <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> those two Companions in <hi>Hypocrisie, that</hi> will God execute upon the Spirit and the Body of an <hi>Hypocrite, I will divide and scatter them.</hi> Before the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is aware of it, an Officer will come from God, that shall say unto him, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. <hi>Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.</hi> So, when the <hi>Body</hi> of the Hypocrite shall have <hi>snakes</hi> and <hi>worms</hi> in a cold Grave crawling about it, then shall the <hi>Spirit</hi> of him in an <hi>hot Hell</hi> be under the gnaws of the <hi>worm,</hi> the <hi>snake,</hi> which <hi>never dyes.</hi> But this is not all; it shall be further done, <hi>In the day wherein God will judge the world by Jesus Christ.</hi> God will then <hi>cut</hi> the Hypocrite <hi>asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> from that Body which heretofore he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly belonged unto. Before the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall expire, we are told in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32. <hi>All Nations shall be gathered together, and he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93737:48"/> shall separate them one from another, as a Shepherd divides his Sheep from the Goats.</hi> God will then <hi>separate</hi> the Hypocrite from all that Society which he crowded once into. Christ, and Saints, and Angels, will then hiss him away with one Voice, <hi>Depart from us, we know thee not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly. The portion of the Hypocrite is, <hi>Weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</hi> It is more than once, that the Oracles of God have pronounced this Doom upon the Hypocrite; we have it particularly in <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. <hi>There shall be weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</hi> It is the same that the Prophet long before sentenced such people unto; in <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.14. <hi>Ye shall cry for sorrow of Heart, and shall howl for vexation of Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is an Intolerable, and an Interminable <hi>Sorrow</hi> which the Hypocrite shall be cast into; this is meant, by the <hi>Weeping</hi> appointed for him. Here he <hi>wept</hi> now and then under the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God; he seem'd as if he were much concerned in them; and perhaps, <hi>he could cry when he would,</hi> as your worst Hypocrites often can? all this was in Jest, and his <hi>Tears</hi> were like those which they report of the <hi>Crocodile.</hi> But God will at last make him <hi>weep</hi> with more Earnest and Horrid Agonies. The <hi>Sorrow</hi> which will torture the Soul of the Hypocrite, will be for and in his <hi>Exclusion</hi> from the Blessed presence of God for ever. It was the Resolve of <hi>David,</hi> in Psal. 101.7. <hi>He that worketh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, shall not dwell within my House; he that telleth Lies, shall not tarry in my sight.</hi> They that go to Heaven, are alwayes in the <hi>House,</hi> and in the <hi>sight</hi> of our <hi>David;</hi> but our <hi>David,</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:93737:49"/> our Jesus will Banish all <hi>Deceitful</hi> Hypocrites from that <hi>House</hi> and <hi>sight</hi> of His for ever; it is an Inscription upon the Golden Gates of Heaven, <hi>Let never any Hypocrite enter here!</hi> Surely, the Hypocrite must <hi>weep</hi> no less than Tears of Blood when he sees the Gates of Heaven shut upon him. When <hi>Esau</hi> lost a <hi>Blessing</hi> for which he had wrought and hop'd considerably, it's said, <hi>He cried with a great and exceeding bitter Cry.</hi> What a <hi>Cry</hi> will it cause in the Hypocrite, when he shall see himself shut out from a Blessed Heaven, after so many <hi>Works,</hi> and so many <hi>Hopes,</hi> for the obtaining of it! We read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.10, 11, 12. <hi>The Door was shut, and they came saying, Lord, Lord, open to us! But He answered, I know you not.</hi> Such a Cry, will the Hypocrite make, when he perceives an Admission into Heaven is denied unto him; <hi>Lord, Lord! Open to me!</hi> and, <hi>Lord, Lord! is this all that my Religion has obtained for me!</hi> and, <hi>Lord, Lord! Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art thou now sending of my desolate Soul!</hi> But what further, what rueful <hi>weeping</hi> will the Hypocrite fall into, when he finds the <hi>Devils</hi> and the <hi>Damned</hi> now his Companions for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! When he lies Roaring in the fiery bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Hell, and crying out, <hi>I am Tormented in this Flame!</hi> When he feels the Wrath of God, like a Stream of Burning Brimstone. Running through his Heart; When he is bleeding and breaking in the <hi>Winepress</hi> of Gods Anger, and is chained up in the <hi>place of Dragons;</hi> and for him then to think, <hi>Here must I Lie, till the very Heavens be no more!</hi> Alas, what <hi>Weeping</hi> mo<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:93737:49"/> he endure, throughout a <hi>Night</hi> that shall never have a <hi>Morning!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not all; there is also a dismal <hi>Vexation</hi> which the Hypocrite shall be cruciated with; here is the <hi>Gnashing of Teeth</hi> reserved for him. A <hi>Fever</hi> or <hi>Ague</hi> begins with a <hi>Gnashing of the Teeth;</hi> it is a terrible <hi>Fever</hi> that the Soul of the Hypocrite shall fall into. His <hi>Diappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> will be such as will make him <hi>gnash his Teeth</hi> for <hi>Vexation</hi> of Soul; it may therefore be said of him, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.10. <hi>He shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his Teeth.</hi> There are especially two vexing Losses, which will make the very <hi>Teeth</hi> of the Hypocrite <hi>chatter</hi> in the Head of him. He shall <hi>first,</hi> find that he has lost all his <hi>Works,</hi> and he will <hi>gnash his Teeth</hi> at such a <hi>Loss.</hi> 'Tis a thousand to one, but the Hypocrite loses even <hi>in</hi> this World, what <hi>of</hi> this World he had been labouring for. <hi>Judas</hi> had play'd the Hypocrite for a little <hi>Money;</hi> but, I pray, what had he got when he came to cast up his Accounts? Methinks, I see how he <hi>gnashed his Teeth,</hi> when he threw down his Money, and said, <hi>Here take it again: I have made but a cursed Bargain of it!</hi> The Hypocrite has been squinting at some secular Advantage in all he did; but it is said in <hi>Job</hi> 8.14. <hi>The Hypocrites Trust shall be as a Spiders Web.</hi> He as it were, unbowell'd himself, to get an Easie Lodging here; but all on the sudden, there comes a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous <hi>Beesom,</hi> that sweeps down all the Riches, and all the Honours, and all the Pleasures which he had been <hi>spinning</hi> for. But be sure, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite loses all his Labours for <hi>another</hi> World.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93737:50"/> His <hi>Faith</hi> is nothing in the account of God, because it is not such as that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. A <hi>Faith unfeigned.</hi> His <hi>Love,</hi> is of no account with God, because it is not such as that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. A <hi>Love without Dissimulation.</hi> All his Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Devotions, they are all thrown away; they are the Sacrifices, that are <hi>Abomination to the Lord.</hi> The Infamous <hi>Jehu,</hi> was a Great Hypocrite; wherefore, though he did many things that God commanded him, yet the Lord said, <hi>I will for those very things be Avenged on him.</hi> After the Hypocrite has been much and long industrious about the Things of God, he will find a <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> written upon it all; the Just God will make him know, <hi>'Tis all weigh'd in the Ballances and found wanting!</hi> And how will it now make him <hi>gnash his Teeth</hi> to think, <hi>All the Hours that I spent in the pretended Service of God, I shall never be one jot the better for them!</hi> But he shall then <hi>likewise</hi> find, that he has lost all his <hi>Hopes;</hi> and he will yet more <hi>gnash his Teeth</hi> at such a <hi>Loss</hi> as that. It is an amazing Enquiry, in <hi>Job</hi> 27.8. <hi>What is the Hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God takes away his Soul?</hi> 'Tis possible the Hypocrite has <hi>gained</hi> some Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and some Figure, by his Devotions; yea, 'tis possible, that he has <hi>gained</hi> some confident <hi>Hope</hi> of Everlasting Blessed ness. But O! what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of that <hi>Hope,</hi> when God summons the poor Man before His Dreadful Tribunal? We are told in <hi>Job</hi> 20.5. <hi>The Joy of the Hypocrite is but for a moment.</hi> Why? because, <hi>The Hope of the Hypocrite is but for a moment.</hi> When the Hypocrite is thrown down into the fiery dismal
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93737:50"/> Vault below, that horrible <hi>Fire-light</hi> will give him a true sight of himself. One of the first Shrieks that he will make, at his going down, will be, <hi>O I hoped for better things than so!</hi> It is said, <hi>They that go down to the Pit cannot Hope.</hi> All the <hi>Hope</hi> that the Hypocrite had of his Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, will be extinguished, when God shall clap him up into the Dungeons of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>Pit.</hi> The Hypocrite is that <hi>Foolish Builder,</hi> whom in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.26. we find mention of; he had built a fair House of a fine Hope; only 'twas on the <hi>Sand;</hi> the Storms of Divine Wrath will shortly overset that <hi>House,</hi> that <hi>Hope.</hi> Now, if as the Wise man speaks, <hi>Hope Deferred makes the Heart sick</hi> what will <hi>Hope Frustrated?</hi> and this, an <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> too? O how he will <hi>gnash his Teeth</hi> to see all his <hi>Hopes</hi> thus at once exterminated!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and Summarily. The <hi>worst</hi> of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments must be the Portion of the Hypocrite. when one would speak of the Hottest and Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est place in Hell, when one would speak of the furthest Pulls on the <hi>Racks</hi> with which undone Sinners are Tormented there, we are to call it, <hi>The Portion of the Hypocrite.</hi> It is said in <hi>Job</hi> 36.13, 14. <hi>The Hppocrites heap up Wrath; and their Life is among the Ʋnlcean.</hi> It is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Wrath;</hi> no, there are vast <hi>Heaps</hi> and Loads and Weights and Mountains of <hi>Wrath,</hi> which the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> has to welter under! He is, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ʋnclean;</hi> it refers to the Destruction that came upon the <hi>Sodomites</hi> of old. God often leaves the Hypocrite unto a Course of some <hi>Ʋncleanness;</hi> it may be that he has been an <hi>old
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93737:51"/> Professor,</hi> but an <hi>old Hypocrite</hi> all the while; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, even in his old Age, he follows a Trade of <hi>Lechery</hi> that could hardly be imagined. However, God will deal with an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> as with another <hi>Sodomite;</hi> he may expect an <hi>Horrible Tempest</hi> of Judgments to rain down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon him; and be sure, he cannot escape the <hi>Vengeance of Eternal Fire.</hi> Yea, unto <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi> our Lord has given that awful Warning in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.24. <hi>It shall be more tolerable for the Land of</hi> Sodom, <hi>than for thee!

                     </gap> called in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.46. <hi>A Portion with Ʋnbelievers</hi> An <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is a sort of an <hi>Infidel;</hi> we say, <hi>Simulata Sanctitas, est Duplex Iniquitas;</hi> it is a wicked thing for a Man to be an <hi>Enemy</hi> unto the God that made him; but for him at the same time to profess a <hi>Friendship</hi> for the Lord, this is a <hi>Double</hi> Wickedness; a <hi>Double</hi> one did I say? nay, 'tis more then a <hi>Treble</hi> one; there is <hi>Atheism,</hi> there is <hi>Ʋnbelief,</hi> there is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <hi>Idolatry</hi> in <hi>Hypocrisie;</hi> 'tis a <hi>Big bellied</hi> Sin. And no wonder then, that it brings forth such astonishing Plagues unto them that are guilty of it. No wonder that our Lord in one Chapter, namely, in the Twenty Third of <hi>Matthew,</hi> pronounces no less than Seven or Eight <hi>Woes</hi> together, upon these <hi>woful</hi> Creatures!

                  <p>Shall I mention a few sorts of Men that have more peculiar cause to be suspicious of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> It is gross Hypocrisie for a Man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Religion,</hi> and intend something else; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Knavery</hi> and <hi>Villany.</hi> It was a Devilish Hypocrisie in <hi>Jezabel,</hi> to seem concerned for the <hi>Name</hi> of God, but really to pursue a <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi> humour of her own. Thus <hi>Herod,</hi> will by all means <hi>worship</hi> our Lord; but his aim was to <hi>murder</hi> him. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> must by all means have the Poor well provided for; whereas, <hi>This he said not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a Thief.</hi> Such was the Hypocrisie of <hi>Saul;</hi> he pretends for the <hi>Battles
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93737:52"/> of the Lord,</hi> when the business was to destroy a Godly Neighbour: In a mighty Zeal for <hi>Israel,</hi> he must clear the Church of all the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> that were now got into it. Such a Zeal for the Church had he, that no <hi>Dissenters</hi> can be spared; but the bottom of the business might be their <hi>Lands,</hi> which lay near to his, might thus fall into his hands. Thus <hi>Absalom</hi> declares for <hi>Church-work,</hi> but <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> lay at the bottom of all. 'Tis frequent for Men to cry up <hi>Diana,</hi> because of the <hi>Shrines.</hi> How many follow our Lord, <hi>because of the Loaves?</hi> Men will be <hi>Ministers</hi> to get a <hi>Living,</hi> and <hi>Church-Members</hi> to get an <hi>Office</hi> among their Neighbours. This was the <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Ye devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayer.</hi> Their way was this; they pray d every day in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue;</hi> and they spent an Hour before Prayer, and an Hour after Prayer, in <hi>Meditation.</hi> Hence all People which now saw them spend so many Hours every Day in Prayer, concluded, <hi>These are brave Men; we can't better dispose of our Estates, than to put them into the hands of such Men as these!</hi> and so they got by the Trick. This now is pure <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It looks Hypocritically for Men to have a <hi>scrupulous tenderness</hi> about a thing of <hi>no consequence,</hi> and make no Conscience of the things that are most <hi>considerable. To strain at a Gnat and swallow a Camel,</hi> is a certain mark in the Throat, by which an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> may be known. 'Tis true, that very <hi>good Men</hi> may be strict about very <hi>small things;</hi> and if we should

You may observe, that the same Sinner who is in the Writings of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> call'd <hi>a Fool,</hi> is in the Book of <hi>Job</hi> call'd <hi>an Hypocrite.</hi> So then, if we would not be found <hi>Fools</hi> at last, or if we would not fall into all those <hi>Miseries</hi> which <hi>Fools</hi> must <hi>suffer because of their iniquities:</hi> O then look to it, that we be not <hi>Hypocrites</hi> before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>When our Lord once had a bigger Auditory than this to Preach unto, and as 'tis reported, <hi>There were gathered together an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people,</hi> he thus began his Holy Sermon in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.1. <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees which is hypocrisie. The leaven of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> is elsewhere expounded, <hi>The doctrine of the Pharisees.</hi> We should therefore in the first place, beware of <hi>corrupt Opinions,</hi> which may have a tendency like <hi>leaven,</hi> to swell and sower our Hearts within us, and so to make us <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi> All corrupt Opinions are <hi>formally</hi> hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie; they seem Truths when they are not so; but some such are <hi>effectively</hi> hypocrisie, they have a tendency to <hi>make</hi> Men hypocrites.

                     <hi>special work</hi> of Gods Grace upon your Souls, you can come up to the Terms of the Gospel; this Opinion will never carry a Man beyond <hi>hypocrisie.</hi> A disputing <hi>Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>To prosecute this, I only recommend these two things unto you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Zealous <hi>Prayers</hi> When the Apostle had found a Man, <hi>whose heart was not right,</hi> said he, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.22. <hi>Pray to God.</hi> O cry mightily to Heaven, that you may not be left unto the delusions of <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> It was the Apostles course for <hi>his People,</hi> in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I pray that ye may be sincere.</hi> Let that be our course <hi>for our selves;</hi> that none of you may be any <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</hi> Pray much, pray hard, and pray <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, <hi>Lord, make my heart sound in thy sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Severe <hi>Tryals.</hi> Follow that method in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your selves, prove your own Souls;</hi> and be very exact, curious, and jealous in the scrutiny. This is a thing which <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> has usually a great antipathy unto; an Hypocrite can't endure the <hi>Touchstone,</hi> If you love to have your Hearts well ransacked for you, and if you are willing and ready to have the <hi>searchers</hi> come aboard you, to see what your <hi>loading</hi> and your <hi>clearing</hi> is, this will
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93737:55"/> be an happy Token of your <hi>sincerity;</hi> and if you are often and strictly <hi>searching</hi> of your own Souls, lest you should have in you any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerned <hi>way of wickedness;</hi> this will be the way to prevent <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am sensible, that I have now delivered a Sermon, that will cause divers Persons to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive,</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>
                     <q>How shall I know whether I been't an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Token I have already given you; that is, <hi>Would you fain be tryed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would further add these two Notes.</p>
                  <p>One is this; No Hypocrite can be humbly thankful for <hi>Afflictions,</hi> because he finds them to bring him nearer to God. The Hypocrite can't feelingly say, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>It is good for me to have been afflicted, that I may learn thy statutes.</hi> Can you heartily bless God that he has crost you, scourged you, bereaved you, and thereby prevented your wandering from him? This I say, <hi>Hereby we know that we are passed from Death to Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another is this: No Hypocrite can live as under the <hi>Eye</hi> of the Great God. The Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite can t really say, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I have set the Lord alwayes before me.</hi> Do you realize the Omnipresence of God? and you so aw'd

            <p>
               <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is by one of the Ancients well called, <hi>A Beholder of great things.</hi> Truly, 'tis a <hi>great thing</hi> which in this Chapter he is <hi>Beholding</hi> of. This <hi>Hieroglyphical Prophet,</hi> for <hi>so</hi> likewwise have Learned Men styled him, in the Beginning of this Chapter, <hi>Beholds</hi> the Restitution of <hi>Israel,</hi> exhibited under the <hi>Hieroglyphic</hi> of a Resurrection from the Dead. <hi>Israel</hi> was once Restored from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity; <hi>Israel</hi> shall yet be more wonderfully, and gloriously Restored from the <hi>Roman</hi> Captivity; both of these Re torations to that <hi>Body Politick</hi> afford a <hi>Type</hi> of what our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bodies</hi> will have experience of, at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Just.</hi> But <hi>Spiritual Mysteries</hi> are also couched in this Admirable Prophecy. All the Articles of it are fulfilled in the <hi>Conversion of a Sinner unto God.</hi> In that marvellous Work,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93737:58"/> a <hi>Dead Soul</hi> comes to be <hi>Raised, Shaped, Clothed,</hi> and <hi>Quickened;</hi> therein also the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of Christ is compleated, just according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that are taken here. And therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving only that Aspect of my Text, you may discern in it the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of unconverted or unrenewed Men; they are <hi>desperate</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. We have two things before us:</p>
            <p>First, Their <hi>Condition.</hi> Their <hi>Bones are dried;</hi> they lie in a <hi>Grave</hi> of Sin and Wretchedness, and they may sigh, <hi>I am Free among the Dead.</hi> They cannot <hi>stir,</hi> they cannot <hi>mind,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>speak,</hi> they are full of all <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness,</hi> and consumed by the <hi>Worms</hi> of Guilt in the <hi>Sepulchers</hi> of Unbelief.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their <hi>Conclusion;</hi> Which is to be reckoned not only among the <hi>Effects,</hi> but also among the <hi>Causes</hi> of their sad <hi>Condition.</hi> They say, <hi>Our hope is lost;</hi> a dismal <hi>Despair</hi> siezes on their Spirits; which as it <hi>Afflicts</hi> them, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it <hi>Restrains</hi> them.

And <hi>then,</hi> That Sentence of Death, is in a dreadful measure <hi>already</hi> executed upon every Man that is not brought home to God. 'Tis said in <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that Believeth not, but the Wrath of God Abiding on him.</hi> The <hi>Devil,</hi> who is the <hi>Angel of Death,</hi> has the Sinner in his cruel Hands;

And there is a concurrence of two things to this Lamentable Incapacity of the Ungodly Man. First, The Man has no <hi>Price</hi> to pay. He cannot <hi>Buy off</hi> the <hi>Punishment</hi> that Sin has devoted him unto: Suppose he could now begin to live a <hi>sinless Life,</hi> yet that would not cross the old Score; the <hi>Debts</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction owing to the Holy God for the many former Transgressions and Violations of his Holy Law, would not thus be cancelled. The <hi>Law</hi> calls for no less than an <hi>Innocent Nature,</hi> and an <hi>uninterrupted Obedience,</hi> which none of us all, after our <hi>First sin,</hi> can pretend unto; it saies in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Cursed is he that continues not.</hi> But besides, the Man cannot but be <hi>sinning,</hi> and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> every day. And what has he, wherewith to make amends for the Wrongs done to that God, who <hi>is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil and who cannot look upon Iniquity?</hi> The Sinner has Nothing to pay; and hence in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. he is called, <hi>A poor and a naked Man.</hi> The Infinite God makes this Demand, <hi>Let my stained Glory be Repaired, or thou shalt lie in the Fiery Prison of my Wrath for ever.</hi> But the Man has nothing to offer by way of Reparation unto God; though he should spend all his Dayes in Tears and Prayers,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93737:60"/> and the most prodigious Mortifications, what would they signifie? 'Tis confessed in <hi>Ps.</hi> 130.3. <hi>O Lord, If thou shouldst mark Iniquity, Lord, who should stand?</hi> Secondly, The Man has also no <hi>Power</hi> to Employ. He cannot <hi>shake off</hi> the <hi>Slavery</hi> which he is by Sin Engaged in. Hence he is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. said to be, <hi>without strength.</hi> The Call of the Lord Redeemer unto him is, <hi>Look to me and be saved;</hi> but alas! he is <hi>without strength.</hi> The Call is <hi>Come to me and have Rest;</hi> but alas! he is <hi>without strength.</hi> It was an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Expostulation used unto them, in <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye believe?</hi> 'Tis to be used unto every Natural Man; <hi>How canst thou</hi> escape the Drudgeries of thy Hellish Task masters? <hi>How canst thou</hi> avoid the violent Oppressors of thy Soul? <hi>How canst thou</hi> come to love and serve God? The Answer, is, <hi>It cannot</hi> be done, except <hi>the Son make him free.</hi>

They conceive the <hi>Terms</hi> between God and them come to such a pass, that they must perish without any <hi>remedy</hi> or <hi>escaping.</hi> This is true <hi>despair.</hi> The sinful and woful <hi>despair</hi> of Men is properly this, <hi>'Tis a disconsolate imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of something in the Purpose or the Power of God which makes their Salvation to be a thing improbable, if not impossible.</hi> Two things are very distinguishing in this <hi>Despair.

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:93737:61"/> of; otherwise.

                  <p>And this <hi>despair</hi> is an <hi>unhappy entanglement</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul that is under the efficacy of it; it extreamly prejudices <hi>the Conversion of the Sinner unto God.</hi> And this upon two accounts.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:93737:61"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> By <hi>despair</hi> all Action is <hi>diverted.</hi> All Mankind is governed by that Proverb, <hi>As good sit still, as rise up and fall down.</hi> No Man will act without an <hi>end.</hi> What is the <hi>end</hi> of our Conversion? 'Tis <hi>the end of our Faith, the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul</hi> When this <hi>end</hi> is wholly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired</hi> of, 'tis even against the Principles of <hi>common Reason,</hi> that a Man should be at any pains to <hi>turn unto the Lord,</hi> or that he should go to <hi>work out his own Salvation.</hi> 'Tis intimated in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Thou saidst, there is no hope. No; for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go. q. d.</hi> We have so long and so far departed from God, that we <hi>despair</hi> of any Reconciliation with him; wherefore we will e'en go on as we have done all this while. Ah, that dull word, <hi>There is no hope!</hi> it cuts the sinews of all <hi>endeavours</hi> in the World. Thus, let a <hi>despairing</hi> Person be called upon to <hi>believe,</hi> he replyes, <hi>No, there is no hope I shall ever be accepted.</hi> Let him be called upon to <hi>repent,</hi> he replyes, <hi>No, there is no hope I shall ever be pardoned.</hi> Let him be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to attend the <hi>means of Grace,</hi> he rejoins, <hi>No, there is no hope I should ever get any good by them.</hi> And the issue is, <hi>After idols he will go.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> By <hi>despair</hi> God himself is provoked.

                        <hi>Consider.</hi> 1. Your Salvation is a thing which the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Great God will be much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and advanced by. You think it an <hi>hard thing</hi> for God to save you; but God will think it a <hi>good thing,</hi> and for his own Honour and Interest. Perhaps you <hi>despair</hi> of Mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you have been a <hi>more than ordinary Sinner.</hi> But, O consider, a <hi>more than ordinary glory</hi> will come to God, if such an one as <hi>you</hi> be saved after all. What is the grand aim of God in the <hi>Justification of the Ʋngodly?</hi> 'Tis to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a great Name; 'tis as we are told in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>To commend his love unto us.</hi> O 'twill <hi>commend the love</hi> of God exceedingly, for the worst of Sinners to be made partakers of it. An extraordinary Sinner in this Country being Fifty Years old, and being brought home to God a few Weeks before he dyed, had these for some of his last words <hi>All Heaven rings at this! A great and an old Sinner coming to glory!</hi> It is a strange but a sweet expression in <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.11. <hi>For thy Names sake O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.</hi> What a word is that! You say, <hi>God won't pardon my iniquity, for it is great,</hi> But the <hi>hope</hi> of the Psalmist argues ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; <hi>The Lord will pardon it, for it is great. Great Sinners</hi> procure <hi>great Praises</hi> un o our God, when they have experience of his <hi>Mercy.</hi> The <hi>greater the Ail,</hi> the <hi>greater the Cure.</hi> A very triumphant shout of <hi>Grace!

                     <p>
                        <hi>Consider.</hi> 2. The <hi>Gospel invitation</hi> makes <hi>your Salvation</hi> among the things that may be hoped

The Lord Jesus Christ is come into the World, one <hi>mighty to save,</hi> one <hi>able to save unto the uttermost.</hi> And who are concerned in it? We are told in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. it was the <hi>chief of Sinners.</hi> It may be thou hast been even a <hi>Ring-leader</hi> in wickedness, yet such as <hi>you</hi> did the Lord Jesus <hi>appear to save.</hi> He does <hi>invite</hi> every one of you to come unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; he sayes in <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that chirsteth, come.</hi> He sayes in <hi>John</hi> 7.37. <hi>If any man thirst, let him come.</hi> You say, <hi>I don't thirst.</hi> To that I Answer, Are you <hi>willing</hi> to come?

Did the Lord Jesus ever say, <hi>I except</hi> John <hi>such an one?</hi> Or, <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> Mary <hi>such an one?</hi> Truly, no.

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Do not <hi>mistake,</hi> and you need not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair;</hi> especially have right Thoughts about <hi>a closure with Jesus Christ.</hi> It is not to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that we may not lay hold on Christ by Faith, till we find such and such remarkable <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of <hi>Humiliati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n</hi> in us. Those Books which tell us we <hi>presume</hi> if we <hi>believe,</hi> before we have arrived unto certain <hi>high strains</hi> of <hi>Contrition</hi> in us, will not bring us to <hi>sincere Conversion,</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:93737:66"/> but <hi>sorrowful Desperation.</hi> Would you have an Heart that may mourn and bleed for Sin? To close with the Lord Jesus Christ, is the way to get such an Heart. We are not to tarry from Jesus Christ until our Hearts are <hi>good;</hi> but we must carry what Hearts we have unto the Lord Jesus, for the mending and changing of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though you <hi>despair</hi> never so much, yet use no <hi>indirect courses</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Despair</hi> some will, with a sort of <hi>Sorcery,</hi> go to comfort or condemn themselves. It was a great Impiety in one under <hi>Despair,</hi> to throw a Glass on the Ground, and say, <hi>As sure as that breaks, I am damned!</hi> though God with infinite Compassion prevented the breaking of it. It is as bad for Persons to let the Bible fall open of it self, resolving that the <hi>first word</hi> they see, shall settle their Opinion of themselves. An ordinary, but an ungodly practice! The Old Heathen used this piece of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> on the Books of their <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> 'Tis a thing as <hi>impious</hi> as <hi>perillous</hi> to abuse the Sacred Bible so.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Despair,</hi> others with <hi>self-murder</hi> go to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy themselves. But unto all that are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried hereunto, I do, as <hi>Paul</hi> to the Jaylor, cry with a loud voice, <hi>Do thy self no harm.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Soul, as yet thou hast a <hi>Door of Hope,</hi> thou may'st yet become an Holy and an Happy Soul, and a <hi>Companion of the Angels</hi> for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. But if thou art a <hi>self-murderer,</hi> there is <hi>no hope;</hi> such wicked Rebels and Fighters against God, go <hi>down to the pit,</hi> in a manner
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93737:67"/> so impenitent, that commonly we <hi>cannot hope</hi> for them. You then that are haunted with sollicitations hereunto, hear the charge of God; go presently, and <hi>reveal</hi> your Case to some Godly and Able Friend. Neither <hi>take</hi> nor <hi>keep</hi> the Devils Counsel; for you have yet <hi>an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time,</hi> yet <hi>a day of Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These things may be spoken, that you may not <hi>despair.</hi> But let no Pillows be thereby sown under the Arms of them, <hi>whom the Lord says, there is no peace unto.</hi> Let every Man <hi>despair</hi> of ever <hi>seeing the Kingdom of God,</hi> unless he be <hi>born again.</hi> Let every Man <hi>despair</hi> of escaping <hi>the Worm which dyeth not, and the Fire which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall be quenched,</hi> if he do not pluck out his <hi>Right-Eye,</hi> and cut off his <hi>Right-Hand</hi> before the Lord. Read that Scripture, take that warning in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. <hi>If a man bless himself in his heart, and say, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart: The Lord will not spare, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousie shall smoke against that man.</hi> O consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it.</p>

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:93737:68"/> they may prick all about them, and yet never fear to be <hi>taken asunder;</hi> when they have their <hi>Drunken Cabals,</hi> and are further <hi>drunk</hi> with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Security, then it is that the consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Wrath of God falls upon them. The sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Captains that cry'd, <hi>Come down, thou Man of God, come down quickly!</hi> instead thereof, they felt the <hi>Fire of God</hi> come down upon them. Thus, when Men are come to say, <hi>Come down Churches!</hi> or <hi>come down Sermons!</hi> or <hi>come down Ministers, come down quickly;</hi> then the Great God will <hi>quickly</hi> bring his Fiery Thundering Plagues upon them.

            <p>THE World has never yet seen the Day, since the Sin and Fall of our unhappy Father, wherein any Man alive had not cause to say, like him in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.1. <hi>I am the Man that hath seen Affliction.</hi> But the World is

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:93737:69"/> in <hi>affliction</hi> proceeds from our not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring and regarding of this <hi>all profitable</hi> Word. I know not whether there be any one thing of a greater Figure in a <hi>Christian Conversation,</hi> than the right bearing of <hi>affliction;</hi> and the Text now before us▪ will assist us to discourse upon that blessed Skill.</p>
            <p>One of the best <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Writers</hi> that ever lived▪ is under the <hi>Inspiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> here making some <hi>Ʋse</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by him in the former part of his Epistle to the <hi>Christianised▪</hi> but <hi>Apostatising</hi> Hebrewes; and indeed, <hi>that</hi> was the usual Method of his Holy Sermons. The Apostolical <hi>Exhortation</hi> in our Context, is, unto a patient perseverance under all the <hi>afflictions</hi> which our profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity may be attended with; and several, weighty▪ pungent Arguments▪ do in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text press that <hi>Exhortation.</hi> One of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments is contained in the Verse now read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; 'Tis drawn, from the Gracious Design of God, in all those <hi>afflictions</hi> which he doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise us with. All the <hi>afflictions</hi> that we are squeez d withal, whether we consider them on <hi>our part,</hi> or on <hi>Gods part,</hi> they carry in them very charming Characters. On <hi>our part,</hi> our <hi>afflictions</hi> come as <hi>witnesses;</hi> they are to witness our being those <hi>Children,</hi> whose <hi>Nurture</hi> the Great God is very careful of. On <hi>Gods part,</hi> our <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> come as <hi>chastisements;</hi> they are to <hi>chastise</hi> us into that <hi>holiness,</hi> and <hi>fruitfulness,</hi> which the God of Heaven is well-pleased with. All of this is insinuated unto us in our Text; which is, <hi>My son, despise not the chastning of the Lord,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93737:70"/> nor faint when rebuked of him.</hi> Before I give you those Remarks, which I am to make upon this Golden Sentence, you must let me mind you of those that are here made by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himself. The Text is a Quotation of what fell from the Pen of <hi>Solomon</hi> Hundreds of Years before, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.11. <hi>My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither be weary of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> The Apostle observes, That it is an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> which may also be rendred, a <hi>Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> there is indeed <hi>Comfort</hi> as well as <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi> contained in it. He again observes, That it <hi>speaks;</hi> no part of the Bible is to be a <hi>dumb</hi> or a <hi>dead</hi> Letter to us; there is a <hi>Voice</hi> in every Line of it. He also observes, That it <hi>speaks</hi> to <hi>us;</hi> The Oracles of the Bible, though they were at first more immediately directed unto these or those, that are now dead and gone, yet <hi>we</hi> should count <hi>our</hi> selves as intimately concerned therein, as if <hi>we</hi> were by Name Addressed in them. He likewise observes, That it speaks to us, as to <hi>Children.</hi> It is in the Quality of a <hi>Father</hi> that our God <hi>afflicts</hi> us from time to time; and it becomes us to maintain the Frames and Hopes of <hi>Children</hi> under such Fatherly Dispensations. He furthermore observes, That our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are both <hi>Chastenings</hi> and <hi>Rebukes</hi> of God upon us; they are <hi>Chastenings,</hi> which implies <hi>Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> with <hi>Instructions</hi> to our Souls; they are also <hi>Rebukes,</hi> which implies <hi>Convictions</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re <hi>Notes</hi> which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himself

               </gap> lying plainly before us here. 'Tis therefore no ill husbandry of the Hour now running▪ to take notice of <hi>those</hi> Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but there is one more which the Apostle would leave <hi>us</hi> to Raise. 'Tis, That there are two <hi>Distempers</hi> which we should under all <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> be concern d for the avoiding of; that in all our <hi>Afflictions</hi> we should keep up a Temper, both in our <hi>Courage</hi> and in our <hi>Patience;</hi> that in our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> there is a <hi>despising,</hi> which is an Excess, or an Error on the <hi>Right Hand,</hi> and there is a <hi>desponding,</hi> which is a Defect, or an Error on the <hi>Left Hand,</hi> very Religiously to be watched against. In fine, This is the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we have to insist upon,</p>
            <p>That on the one side a <hi>despising</hi> of, on the other side, a <hi>desponding</hi> at, Afflictions, is an Evil which 'tis our Duty carefully to avoid.</p>
            <p>Behold now incumbent on us a double Duty, with reference to those <hi>Afflictions</hi> which in an evil World we meet withal.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p n="1">I. It must be our study to avoid the <hi>despising</hi> of <hi>Afflictions</hi> We must not sleight them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn them, disregard them, or treat them as if we were not concerned in them; but a positive Respect un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o them, is also required of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> It is our Duty to be affectionately sensible of the Blows, which by Afflictions are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93737:71"/> given to us: A <hi>quick sense</hi> usually accompanies the Grace of God in the Heart of Man. A stupid, and a sottish Temper under <hi>Afflictions,</hi> is very contrary to the Expectations of the Lord our God; a <hi>Stoical Apathy</hi> is no <hi>Christian Vertue;</hi> but it is mentioned as a great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in <hi>Jer</hi> 5.3. <hi>O Lord, Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved.</hi> Our God has bestowed <hi>Affections</hi> upon us, and He expects that they should be suitably moved by such <hi>Afflictions</hi> as He shall visit us withal. We must not receive the <hi>Blowes</hi> of God, like a <hi>Stock fish,</hi> without any feeling of them; but every afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man should with some sensible Passions feel, <hi>This is a sore Chastening and Rebuke upon me.</hi> It was brought in as a sad Indictment against that insensible People, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.25. <hi>The fire burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</hi> For Afflictions to come and <hi>burn</hi> us out of our Enjoyments, and yet for us to keep <hi>Hearts</hi> untouch'd with a sense of what has befallen us, is to <hi>despise the Chastening of the Lord.</hi> It is to put off <hi>Humanity</hi> it self; and, I pray, what Rule have we in <hi>Divinity</hi> for doing so? We should have our pensive Resentments of our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> whether we look upon them as <hi>natural</hi> or as <hi>paenal</hi> Evils. There never was a stouter Hero than <hi>David,</hi> who yet melted into Tears when he saw the Frowns of God upon him. When one was taken with a <hi>Distemper,</hi> that had some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> it was said of her, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>If her Father had spit in her Face, should she not be ashamed?</hi> Thus ought we to entertain our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> as things that are to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93737:71"/> humble us, and abase us before the Lord. There is a <hi>comfortable Order</hi> of our Conditions and Circumstances, which God himself has implanted into us the desires of; this Order is invaded and disturbed by all of our <hi>Afflictions;</hi> and it is a Sin for us now to stupifie our just Apprehensions hereof, by saying, <hi>Well, It can't be help'd;</hi> and, <hi>There's an end on't;</hi> or by using the <hi>Cauteries</hi> which were the Common Reliefs of the Ancient Heathen, in their Distresses; this is, as one says, to have in our Souls a <hi>Calm,</hi> like that of the <hi>Dead Sea;</hi> 'tis indeed a <hi>Calm</hi> with a <hi>Curse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> It is our Duty to be awfully sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the <hi>Hand</hi> from which <hi>Afflictions</hi> come unto us. We must not reckon our Affliction to be meer <hi>casual Events,</hi> or the Effects of <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Injury</hi> from our Neighbours; but we are to think, as in <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> No, There shall not be so much as an House in all the Town robbed or burned, but there shall be a <hi>doing</hi> of the Lord about it. In our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> we must look beyond <hi>Second Causes,</hi> and believe the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of the Great God about them all, and say with our selves, <hi>I have to do with God in all of these Calamities.</hi> Many in their Afflictions only <hi>look downward;</hi> but we are to cast our Eyes another way, and <hi>look upward,</hi> that we may see the Original of all our Troubles; and we are to think, like him in <hi>Job</hi> 5 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Affliction comes not forth of the Dust, neither d <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h Trouble spring out of the Ground.</hi> It may be that <hi>Affliction</hi> has laid
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93737:72"/> our delights in the Dust, and in the <hi>ground▪</hi> yet we must not think the <hi>Affliction</hi> proceeds from so <hi>low</hi> a cause. In all our <hi>losses,</hi> it becomes us to say with him of old, <hi>The Lord has taken away;</hi> and in all the <hi>wrongs</hi> that have been done unto us, we should say with him, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Tis God has bidden it.</hi> Though the <hi>Arrows</hi> of Affliction that are shot at us, do seem to come never so much <hi>at a venture,</hi> yet we must perswade our selves that the <hi>Hand</hi> of God has the directing of them. <hi>Afflicted</hi> Men do often say, 'twas their <hi>Fortune</hi> to meet with such or such a disaster; <hi>thy For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> Man; for shame, take no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Name of that <hi>Idol</hi> into thy Mouth. We may not ascribe unto a <hi>blind chance</hi> any of those Afflictions which our affairs are crippled with. Although the <hi>Hand</hi> of God in our Afflictions be wrapt up in a Cloud, yet should the sight of our Souls penetrate unto it; and God should not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from us by the crowd of immediate <hi>Agent,</hi> which are the Instruments of our Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is our Duty to be Piously sensible of the <hi>end</hi> for which <hi>Afflictions</hi> come upon us. We must imagine that our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the All-Wise God, with some aim at our amendment and improvement; and we should often ask, like her of old, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> 'Tis the Command in <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Hear the rod.</hi> We are to think that there is a loud <hi>call</hi> and <hi>voice</hi> of God in every <hi>Rod</hi> with which he does afflict us; we should labour to <hi>know,</hi> and labour to <hi>do</hi> those things about which our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are the <hi>Monitors</hi> of our God unto us. In all Afflictions
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93737:72"/> we should seriously request, like him in <hi>Job</hi> 10.3. <hi>Shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</hi> We should inquire what <hi>Sin</hi> our <hi>Afflictions</hi> come to correct us for? and we should presently set upon a thorough <hi>Repentance</hi> of that <hi>evil way;</hi> we should presently stone that <hi>Achan</hi> which has been the <hi>Troubler</hi> of us; and we should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently cast over the Wall the Head of that <hi>Sheba</hi> which has caused the Armies of Heaven to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagure us. We should inquire what <hi>good</hi> our <hi>Afflictions</hi> come to excite us to? And we should presently set upon the expressing of that <hi>Grace</hi> and the performing of that <hi>work,</hi> which we find our selves now under a new obligation to; we should presently bring forth such <hi>Fruits</hi> as all our prunings and purgings are designed for. If our <hi>Afflictions</hi> produce not such things as these upon us, they are but like stripes bestow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hide of <hi>a wild Asses Colt.</hi> Never was there a sadder or a blacker brand upon a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Man, than that in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. <hi>In the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the Lord.</hi> And there never was a more doleful sight in the World, than that of <hi>a Thief on the Cross continuing his malignity against the Son of God.</hi> Would you hear what is <hi>meet</hi> for us under our Afflictions? I ll tell you then, in the best words that can be spoken; I mean those in <hi>Job</hi> 34.31. <hi>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have born chastisement, I will not offend any more.</hi> If we do not thus behave our selves under our <hi>Affliction,</hi> we <hi>despise the chastning of the Lord.</hi> But this is not all our Duty; <hi>pars superest.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:93737:73"/>II. It must also be our study to avoid the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding</hi> at <hi>Afflictions.</hi> Our Souls must not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any <hi>dissolution</hi> by them; nor must we suffer our selves to be thereby <hi>relaxed</hi> into the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Impatience. But more positively and particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is our Duty to undergo <hi>Afflictions</hi> with a submissive <hi>Contentation</hi> of Soul. We must keep our Souls from those <hi>Deliquia ac De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liria,</hi> those wretched <hi>swoonings</hi> which Afflictions may dispose us unto. But how? 'Tis said in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.19. <hi>In your patience possess ye your souls.</hi> There is a sinful <hi>Patience,</hi> which renders the Soul a <hi>Galley-slave,</hi> there is a Brutal <hi>Patience</hi> which renders the Soul an <hi>Issachar,</hi> under all Afflictions; and there is a Moral Bravery which <hi>Pagans</hi> have sometimes born their Trials with. But our Lord says, <hi>You must have [your] Patience;</hi> 'tis a <hi>Christian</hi> Patience, which we are to be studious of. Under Afflictions, we have these Two comprehensive Things to do, for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting</hi> of us; both of them intimated in <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.9.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Under Afflictions we are to suppress all <hi>Tumultuous Discomposures</hi> in our selves; there is an Holy <hi>Silence</hi> which we are now to command our selves into. Our God sayes to us, as to the disconsolate Parent in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.16. <hi>Refrain thy Voice from weeping, and thine Eyes from Tears.</hi> Be not immoderate in any of thy Lamentations. There are Discomposures of <hi>Tongue</hi> which are now to be restrained. In our Afflictions we
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93737:73"/> must beware of hasty <hi>Wishes;</hi> we may not now fly out into the Distemper of <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he was e'en tired with his Troubles, and said, <hi>It is enough; now▪ O Lord, take away my Life.</hi> Nor may we now fall into the Distemper of <hi>Job,</hi> when he saw that he was not enough pittied by his Neighbours, <hi>May their Soul be in my Souls s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d Bulls in a Net, filled with the Fury of the Lord.</hi> Nor may we now Rail at <hi>Man,</hi> like the Raging <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, crying out upon <hi>Moses,</hi> as the Authour of all the Destruction that came upon them. There are likewise Discomposures of <hi>Heart,</hi> which are now to be Restrained. Sayes the Apostle, <hi>I would have you without Distraction;</hi> there are <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Griefs</hi> which wonderfully <hi>distract</hi> the Souls of them [like an Army in a Rout] that cross Accidents come tumbling in upon. We must not suffer our Souls to be <hi>distracted</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> into incohaerent Motions as may unfit us for Communion with the Lord our God. We must not like <hi>David</hi> onc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93737:74"/> that I feel.</hi> 'Tis the Sight of God that must allay all the Madness and Foaming which we now find our selves prone unto; thus <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Endured, as seeing him who is In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi> We should keep our Souls in Order, by having our Eyes upon the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God. We must confess, as in <hi>Job</hi> 9.12. <hi>None may say to Him, What dost thou?</hi> And for this Reason, we should have no secret Clamours in our Souls, when he goes to meddle with any of our Darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; we must have no <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> in our Transactions with God, but let Him take all, because as <hi>David</hi> said once of his Riches, <hi>Lord, All of this is Thine alone.</hi> We should likewise keep our Souls in Order, by having our Eyes upon the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God. We must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, as in <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Thou art Just in all that is brought upon us, for thou hast done Right, but we have done wickedly:</hi> and for this Reason we should be free from all Murmurings at what comes upon us. In the worst of our Difficulties, we should call to mind, <hi>My own Doings have procured these things unto me!</hi> and say, <hi>Why should any Man alive complain of the punishment of his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities?</hi> We should moreover, Eye the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, for the Calming our Souls. We must confess with him in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.175. <hi>Thou in Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness hast Affiicted me.</hi> And therefore we should perswade our selves, that the Faithful God is but fulfilling of his Covenant in all the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies that may befal us; that He can <hi>bring forth Meat out of the Eater,</hi> and that we <hi>now know not what He does, but we may hereafter.</hi> We should furthermore Eye the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God for
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93737:74"/> the composing of our Spirits in our saddest Hours. We are to confess with him in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>It is good for me, that I have been afflicted.</hi> And hence, we should humbly conceive that we shall not be losers by any of our Mishaps; but that our God will <hi>try us and prove us, to do us good in the latter end:</hi> And we should impute all to <hi>love,</hi> think, <hi>'Tis because God loves me, that he does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke and chasten me.</hi> Finally, We should Eye the <hi>Fulness</hi> of God, for the rectifying of what wild Thoughts we may have about our Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. We should hear the God of Heaven say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am the All-sufficient God.</hi> And hence, we should in the absence and withdrawing of all other things, yet satisfie our selves by this, <hi>God is my portion still, and He is All, and infinitely more than All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> 'Tis our Duty to undergo <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> with a believing <hi>Expectation</hi> of Soul. When we are never so much <hi>disquieted,</hi> yet are we to lay that Charge upon our selves, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 43.5. <hi>O my Soul, hope in God, for I shall yet praise him.</hi> An <hi>Affliction,</hi> though it bear never so hard upon us, yet it should not kill our <hi>hope in God</hi> for the good issue of it. In the midst of all our Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations we should still be of that Principle, in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26. <hi>It is good that a man should hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of God.</hi> An hopeless <hi>Despair</hi> in Affliction, is the <hi>fainting</hi> of the Soul: An afflicted Man should still keep alive Two Expectations. One thing to be expected by him, is that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.5. <hi>They that sow in Tears shall reap in Joy.</hi> We should expect, That the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93737:75"/> Clouds will one Day blow over, and that we shall one Day be at rest from the Loads that now lie upon us: And suppose we, <hi>Non si male nunc, &amp; olim sic erit;</hi> —but, that as it is said, <hi>The Lord will not always chide.</hi> Another thing to be expected is, that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> We should expect, That we shall be <hi>Gainers</hi> by all our Sorrows; and we should say of our selves, as one of the Martyrs did, <hi>My God is now scouring of me, that He may set me among His Vessels of Honour, on an High Shelf in Heaven for ever;</hi> and we should say to our selves, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Martyrs did, <hi>Hold out, O my Faith and Patience, hold out a little more, and Heaven will quickly make amends for all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis our Duty to undergo <hi>Afflictions</hi> with a Gracious <hi>Resolution</hi> of Soul. We should not by <hi>Affliction</hi> be discouraged in <hi>Devotion,</hi> but say with a Noble Zeal, as he in <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Afflictions</hi> overtake us, we should still <hi>cleave,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas</hi> expressed it, <hi>with full purpose of Heart unto the Lord;</hi> and we should be able still to say like them, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 41.17, 18. <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, O Lord.</hi> We should be resolved for the Service of God, though the <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> should molest us in it. <hi>Cain</hi>'s Club should not make us at all abate of our <hi>sacrificing</hi> to the Lord: Though the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors keep roaring like so many <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Leopards</hi> upon us, yet should we resolve like

There is an obstinate <hi>Stupidity,</hi> in that Soul, which Afflictions will not awaken to Repentance. 'Tis from the Hardness of our Hearts, that we should need any Afflictions to reduce us from our Evil Ways; that the sweet Invitations of the Gospel will not operate so far upon us as to bring us home to our God; that He must use <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> upon us, before we can be taught <hi>what an evil and a bitter thing it is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Lord.</hi> But for a Man to go on in sin, after that Affliction has been employ'd upon him, this truly is a more abominable Hardness. We may say of such doleful unreclaimable Creatures, as in <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.12. <hi>They have made their Hearts, as an Adamant Stone, and there is great Wrath upon them.</hi> We read concerning the <hi>Word</hi> of God, <hi>That it is an Hammer which breaks the Rocks to pieces.</hi> But what an Heart

Hearken to this, You that continue in your Sins, albeit one Affliction after another has been plaguing of you; You are like that wicked <hi>Hiel,</hi> the Prodigies of the World. Yea, Let me go on to say, There is a <hi>Devilish Obstinacy</hi> in the Soul, whom Afflictions do not good unto. It has been said, <hi>Perseverare in peccato est Diabolicum;</hi> But what a Degree of <hi>Devillism</hi> then is it for a Man to persevere in his Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties after he has been Afflicted for them? 'Tis the Malignity of the <hi>Devils</hi> in Hell; the foul Fiends of Darkness, are Tormented for their <hi>Enmity</hi> to God, and yet they go about with horrible fiery Chains of Guilt upon them, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> in that Cursed <hi>Enmity.</hi> You that will continue in <hi>Rebellion</hi> against God, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all your <hi>Afflictions</hi> from Him, I pray, whom do you take for your <hi>Father</hi> in this your Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness?

                     <p>The manifold Evil of giving way to our unruly and unquiet Spirit, in our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> is enough to fright us into Moderation. 'Tis said, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.10. <hi>If thou faint in the day of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, thy strength is small.</hi> So indeed it is; but I have a worse thing also to say of it; namely this, <hi>Thy Sin is great.</hi> It argues a fearful deal of <hi>Corruption</hi> in us, when <hi>Affliction</hi> on us is not born with much Resignation of Soul. You find in <hi>Jude</hi> 15. in that one Verse, there is <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness</hi> at least four times over-charged upon sinful Men; and, What is the Description of these <hi>ungodly</hi> ones? It follows, <hi>These are Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers, Complainers.</hi> Truly, there is a world of <hi>ungodliness</hi> in our <hi>Murmurings</hi> and <hi>Complainings</hi> under our Afflictions. When the <hi>Israelites</hi> had been <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>complaining</hi> under the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of the Wilderness, it is added in <hi>Num.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Aarons Rod was kept for a Token against the Rebels.</hi> Why, there is a cursed <hi>Rebellion</hi> that <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>complaining</hi> which our Afflicted Spirits do often <hi>faint</hi> into. 'Tis below a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. I remember, <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of a certain People, who if they saw a Man over-much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with any Affliction, condemned him to wear the Habit of a <hi>Woman</hi> all his Days; because that such an one did, as it were, <hi>unman</hi> himself. Even so, They that are unable to bear Affliction, do, in a sort, <hi>unchristianize</hi> themselves; 'tis not fit you should wear the Badge of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> till you know what it is to lye still, when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93737:80"/> the Heavenly Chirurgeon is lancing of you. In short, By this <hi>Faintness</hi> you undo all your <hi>Prayers.</hi> I suppose, you do not use the <hi>Lords-prayer,</hi> as the <hi>Form</hi> of your Devotions; yet you must make it the <hi>Rule</hi> of them. But, as Father <hi>Latymer</hi> speaking of <hi>Peter</hi>'s denying his Lord, had this Note upon it, <hi>Peter</hi> forgot his <hi>Pater Noster;</hi> for that was, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> and <hi>Thy Kingdom come:</hi> So may it be said now to us, You forget your <hi>Prayer;</hi> your Prayer is, <hi>Thy Will be done;</hi> and yet, when you see that <hi>Will done,</hi> you <hi>faint</hi> under it, as if you were your selves <hi>undone.</hi> I know not what your <hi>other</hi> Afflictions are, but this I affirm, Your <hi>fainting</hi> under those Afflictions, is a greater Affliction it self, than any of the rest. It is that horrible Plague whereof we read in <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. <hi>The spirit of a man shall sustain his infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can bear?</hi> Cheer up then, my Afflicted Neighbours; be of a good Heart; be <hi>faithful,</hi> and not <hi>fainting</hi> in all your Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and receive that Advice from God this Day, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Thou shalt consider in thy Heart, that as a Man chastens his Son, so the Lord thy God chastens thee.</hi>

            <p>AND I must endeavour to <hi>perswade</hi> you, as I do my self <hi>believe,</hi> That he <hi>said</hi> very well: I am sorry to see what hard Thoughts are commonly taken up, concerning the Holy <hi>David,</hi> for passing such a Sentence as has now been read unto us. You know, That when <hi>David</hi> was flying before the General Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Rebellion of the People under wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Absalom,</hi> one <hi>Ziba,</hi> a crafty Person, that had the sense to foresee the Issue of that Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93737:82"/> addresses himself to <hi>David,</hi> with a false Accusation against his Landlord <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> as if he had been a Well-willer to the Conspiracy. <hi>David</hi> then being in an Hasty <hi>Passion,</hi> and being byassed by a Kindness received at such a Season, and not imagining that <hi>Ziba</hi> would impose upon him with a Lye, that might easily have been detected, <hi>rashly</hi> ordered this Calumniator to be made <hi>Owner</hi> of the Land, whereof he had been but a <hi>Tenant</hi> heretofore. But at the Return of <hi>David,</hi> Honest <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> having opportunity to vindicate himself, <hi>David</hi> gives the Sentence now recited; and it is commonly supposed, That herein <hi>David</hi> still renews and confirms at least, part of the Sentence, which he had before so <hi>rashly</hi> uttered. Not only have the most of Christian Expositors cry'd out upon <hi>David,</hi> for his extream and cruel Harshness, in giving away unto a false Loon, half the Land of Innocent <hi>Mephibosheth;</hi> but also the Jewish Expositors make hard Reflections upon <hi>David</hi> for his Action here; and they make this Remark upon it, <hi>I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the Land; At the same Instant the Providence of God said, Then let</hi> Rehoboam <hi>and</hi> Jeroboam <hi>divide the Kingdom.</hi> Whereas, in my Opinion, we have hitherto done more Injury and Injustice to <hi>David,</hi> than ever he did unto <hi>Mephibosheth. David,</hi> if I do not mistake, does here only and fully Revoke a piece of <hi>Rashness,</hi> which he had before fallen into. And I thus advance towards the Proof of my Exposition.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:93737:82"/>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis uncharitable to suppose, <hi>David</hi> would wrong <hi>Mephibosheth.</hi> To take away the Livings of so blameless and righteous a Person, because a base Fellow had <hi>belyed</hi> him, would have been a most abominable thing. The <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of a <hi>David</hi> would not have permitted him to be baffled and befool'd by such a palpable Cheat as would now have been put upon him; especially when a Thousand Men of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> were now at his Elbow to give him a true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: He had a little before been called, <hi>One like an Angel of God, to discern Good and Bad;</hi> whereas now, it must have been said, <hi>There are few Mortals but what would have had more Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them.</hi> Nor would the <hi>Justice</hi> of a <hi>David</hi> allow'd a Judgment so unreasonable as well as arbitrary; it was after said, <hi>He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and turned not aside, all the dayes of his life, but only in the matter of Ʋrijah;</hi> whereas we must now have look'd for one Exception more, <hi>And in the matter of abused Mephibosheth.</hi> Besides all this, The <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>David</hi> for the Father of <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> his old and his dear Friend <hi>Jonathan,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with such a piece of barbarous Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; a <hi>love</hi> beyond that of a <hi>Woman,</hi> to the Father, would not so easily sowre into a <hi>wrath</hi> beyond that of an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the Son; and this the rather, because the very <hi>Beard</hi> and <hi>Garb</hi> of the disconsolate <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> was enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his Innocency. I add,</p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:93737:83"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As he <hi>would</hi> not, so he <hi>did</hi> not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit so great a Wrong. And methinks, the Holy Spirit of God, seems to invite us unto such an Apprehension; by the dislocation of the Story. For, I pray, mark it; In the Twenty third Verse, you have <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Jordan;</hi> and again, at the Thirty first Verse you have <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Jordan;</hi> and yet in the Story of <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> which lies between those Two Verses, you have <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Now, whence this dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation! how comes the Story of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> to be thus anticipated? There was doubtless a reason for it; and it might be this. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Paragraph, you have <hi>Shimei</hi> and <hi>Ziba</hi> (a very proper Couple!) both meeting of <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Jordan.</hi> There you find that <hi>Shimei,</hi> a baul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, railing, bloody Traitor, upon his confession obtains the pardon of his Crimes. Well, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon this, the Discourse between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> though it happened some time after, is introduced here. Which may sufficiently suggest unto us. If <hi>David</hi> could be so easily reconciled unto a cursed <hi>Shimei,</hi> certainly, he could not be inexorable to an harmless <hi>Mephibosheth;</hi> he that would not hear <hi>Abishai</hi> pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sing for a revenge upon a <hi>Shimei,</hi> would hear a just <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> making a just Apology for himself.</p>
            <p>But after all, The Hinge of all will turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true and right Notion of the Bargain heretofore made, about the Lands of <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth.</hi> You shall read, I'l show you, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Covenant about those famous Lands; 'tis
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93737:83"/> in 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 9.10, — <hi>The King called to Ziba, Sauls servant, and said unto him, I have given to thy Masters son all that pertained to</hi> Saul, <hi>and all his House. Thou therefore shalt till the Land for him, and thou shalt bring in the Fruits, that thy Masters son may have food to eat. But</hi> Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth <hi>thy Masters son, shall eat Bread alwayes at my Table. And</hi> Mephibosheth <hi>had a young son, whose name was</hi> Mica. Upon the whole, I thus understand the Contract. <hi>Ziba</hi> was not <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor</hi> of these Lands; but was a <hi>Tenant,</hi> or, more properly, a <hi>Bayliff,</hi> or a <hi>Steward</hi> of them. <hi>Ziba</hi> was to Till the Lands; but how were the Profits to be disposed of? Why thus; One half of the Ioncomes was for the maintenance of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> at the Court; it was to bear his Court-Expences. For, when <hi>David</hi> invited <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> to Court, it was not that he might there live upon Alms; but it was out of respect and friendship to him, as the like was done to <hi>Barzillai</hi> afterwards; and perhaps, there was a <hi>Reason of State</hi> in it, which there is no need of mentioning. He was to live in Port, as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Quality, with his Retinue there; and half the Revenue of his Lands was to maintain it. But which way went the other half? The Product of the other half was divided between <hi>Mica</hi> and <hi>Ziba</hi> himself; in short, <hi>Ziba</hi> has a Moiety for the maintenance of <hi>Mica,</hi> and hires a Moiety for the maintenance of <hi>Mephibosheth;</hi> and upon that Score, 'tis said, <hi>All that dwelt in</hi> Ziba<hi>'s House, were servants to</hi> Mephibosheth. Well then, when <hi>David</hi> now says, <hi>I have said, Thou and</hi> Ziba <hi>divide the Land;</hi> he does but
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93737:84"/> unsay what he had rashly said when <hi>Ziba</hi>'s Lye surprized him; and orders things to be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the first settlement and contrivance of them; 'tis <hi>q. d. I now recal the rash words I spoke about your Lands,</hi> Mephibosheth; <hi>you need be at no further care; you know what I said in our first Act of Settlement; I would have that stand for the present; you shall enjoy all that I had rashly taken from you.</hi> If any now object, that our <hi>David</hi> went not far enough, in making Reparations to <hi>Mephibosheth;</hi> why did not he take <hi>Ziba,</hi> and hang him! Tis Answer enough, That it was now no <hi>time</hi> for <hi>that;</hi> and what was done after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>who can tell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see how far my concernment for the Honour of <hi>David</hi> has transported me; and it will be more <hi>David</hi>'s wrong than mine, if you don't embrace my Interpretation. But it is now time for me to tell you, what it is that I am driving at; it is, this all-concerning</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93737:86"/> what <hi>rash things</hi> we do; but after we have done them, we should then view them, and scan them over again, for our humiliation before the Lord. We are told, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. Men should say, <hi>What have I done?</hi> When we have done a <hi>rash thing,</hi> we should cast it into the Scales, not only of <hi>Reason,</hi> but of <hi>Scripture</hi> too, and with sorrow say, <hi>O what have I done!</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had once done a <hi>rash thing,</hi> 'tis added, <hi>His heart smote him.</hi> There are certain <hi>smitings of Heart,</hi> with which we are to reflect upon the <hi>rash</hi> Actions of our Lives.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93737:91"/> there is no <hi>hope of Mercy</hi> for them. But it is a <hi>rash thing</hi> for any to imagine so; and the God of Heaven takes these <hi>rash thoughts</hi> very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly from us. He says in <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.8. <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts.</hi> I do <hi>boldly,</hi> and yet not <hi>rashly,</hi> affirm it, that for ought any of you know, you may (even the blackest and old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Sinner among you all) be <hi>predestinated</hi> for a glorious place among the Angels of God for ever. If any of you are under Fears that you have committed the <hi>unpardonable Sin,</hi> I may tell you that you are yet <hi>free from the great Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi> I do <hi>further,</hi> and not <hi>rashly,</hi> affirm it, that there is not the wickedest Creature in all this Congregation, which would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably welcome unto the Lord Jesus Christ upon their Humble Addresses: Go, in Gods Name, go after all your multiplyed Iniquities, carry a distressed and a perishing Soul to the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>He will not cast you out!</hi> Some of you are haunted with such Thoughts as have a monstrous <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> in them; it will be a <hi>rash thing</hi> for you now to think, <hi>That God has cast you off.</hi> No, I can assure you, that such Injections do rarely trouble the Minds of any but such as are already the true Children of God. They are <hi>Darts</hi> which the Devil would poyson and inflame your Hearts withal: But unless he perceive a person to be one that will be <hi>troubled</hi> for the Sins of Thoughts, he will not give these molestations to them. Now, <hi>that</hi> is the Character of them that are <hi>born again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:93737:91"/>
                  <p>In a word, you that have heretofore expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a <hi>regenerating work</hi> of God upon your Souls; pray, do you beware of <hi>rash Jealousies</hi> about your selves. It was a <hi>rash</hi> word of her, <hi>My God has forgotten me, and forsaken me.</hi> It was a <hi>rash</hi> word of him, <hi>I shall one day perish by the hands of my enemy.</hi> The Saints have spoken such <hi>rash</hi> words, but they have been forced afterwards to say, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.10. <hi>This is my infirmity;</hi> 'twas <hi>rashly</hi> spoken of me. For you to make <hi>nothing</hi> of <hi>all</hi> that God has done in bringing of you home unto himself, you are not well aware how displeasing this may be to the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Beware of <hi>rash Promises.</hi> A <hi>rash Promise</hi> made unto <hi>Man</hi> layes an unhappy snare for the Maker of it. It is the badge of a good Man in <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.4. <hi>He swears to his own hurt, and changeth not.</hi> We <hi>rashly</hi> promise many a thing; and, if it be a lawful thing, it may be for our <hi>hurt</hi> if we keep it, but it will be much more for our <hi>hurt</hi> if we break it; if it be a wicked thing we must break it, and not keep it; but then we must own with shame the <hi>hurt</hi> we did in making it. The <hi>rash Promise</hi> which <hi>Israel</hi> made unto the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> was an occasion of much Temptation afterwards unto them. You will do well never to make a <hi>Promise</hi> unto a Neighbour without a <hi>reserve;</hi> and never to <hi>promise</hi> but when you are both willing and able to <hi>perform.</hi> A <hi>rash Promise</hi> to do a thing may be very pernicious to us, and so may a <hi>rash Promise</hi> not to do a thing. A Church-Member once being admonished, that he would repent
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93737:92"/> of a miscarriage which he would not own, <hi>rashly</hi> replyed, <hi>No, I'll burn before I'll turn.</hi> And the House of this Man was quickly after burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, himself perishing in the Flames. This, as to <hi>Man.</hi> But a <hi>rash Promise</hi> made unto <hi>God,</hi> yet further entangles, as well as defiles and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes the Soul that makes it. What says the Wise Man in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2, 5. <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: Better it is that thou shouldest not vow, than vow and not pay.</hi> It is a <hi>rash thing</hi> for a Man to <hi>vow</hi> a thing beyond his own <hi>reach;</hi> such a <hi>rashness</hi> there often is in the Popish <hi>Vows</hi> of <hi>Continency.</hi> It is much more a <hi>rash thing</hi> for a Man to <hi>vow</hi> a thing against Gods <hi>Law.</hi> There was an execrable <hi>rashness</hi> in the Vow of those Miscreants, who <hi>vow'd</hi> the Death of the Apostle <hi>Paul;</hi> and so there was in the Vow of <hi>Herod,</hi> who swore (I suppose by his own <hi>Head</hi>) what he thought bound him to cut off the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> though one of the Antients has found a way, you know, to have brought him off. In short, it is a <hi>rash thing</hi> to vow any thing that shall not be <hi>commanded</hi> by God, or <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>serviceable</hi> to him. We should therefore look narrowly into all the circumstances of our <hi>Vows,</hi> before we venture upon them. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose 'tis the want of this that has given cause for that Observation, That a Nation or People hardly ever made a <hi>Vow,</hi> or Covenant, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement against any one thing, but they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>did</hi> that very thing. You may, if you please, apply the Observation!</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:93737:92"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beware of <hi>rash Prejudices.</hi> How often do profane Men take up a <hi>Prejudice</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truths and Ways, and People of God! They know that all the <hi>Religion</hi> they have themselves, is but <hi>Hypocrisie;</hi> and so they clamour that there is nothing but <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> in the <hi>Religion</hi> of other Men. Perhaps they have seen one <hi>Church-Member</hi> prove a <hi>Beast,</hi> or a <hi>Knave;</hi> and then they cry out, <hi>They are all so!</hi> This now is a piece of most Brutal <hi>Rashness.</hi> To cure so Rash a Prejudice, I shall only say what was heretofore said in that very case in <hi>John</hi> 1.46. <hi>Come and see.</hi> We should be in like manner wary how we take up a <hi>rash Prejudice</hi> against this or that particular Person in the World; we should not be ready to <hi>censure</hi> a Man, as a stranger to the fear of God, because we can't readily comprehend something that the Man says, or does, or meets withal. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour forbids this <hi>rash judging</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Judge not.</hi> It was a <hi>rash</hi> thing in the Disciples, when they saw a Blind Man, to say, <hi>Who is the Sinner now!</hi> And <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends had like to have paid for a <hi>rash</hi> thing, when they imputed hard things to him, because God inflicted <hi>hard things</hi> on him. This <hi>wariness</hi> is peculiarly to guard us from a <hi>rash Prejudice</hi> against any Man who may otherwise be an Instrument of much good unto us; a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> a <hi>Minister,</hi> or the like. It was the Complaint of the Prophet in <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.50. <hi>I heard the defaming of many, Report, say they, and we will report it.</hi> There is no Servant of the Publick, but he is traduced with <hi>false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> carried up and down the Country; and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93737:93"/> these <hi>Reports</hi> beget <hi>rash Prejudices</hi> in the Spirits of the People against the best Friends they have in the World; it is impossible to express the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Mischief and Phrensie of these <hi>Prejudices;</hi> but we should not be so <hi>rash</hi> as to be thus easily imposed upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Beware of <hi>Rash Conjectures.</hi> 'Tis an usual thing that Men go to shape some <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture</hi> upon the cause of this or that Calamity that comes upon a place; but there is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a World of <hi>Rashness</hi> in their <hi>Conjectures.</hi> Unless we see the <hi>Sins</hi> committed, which the Word of God <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> threatens those <hi>Judgments</hi> of Heaven for, we should not be very positive in saying, <hi>The Judgments are come for such or such a cause.</hi> What a <hi>rash</hi> thing was it in them of old, who counted <hi>that</hi> the original of all the Calamities which came upon them, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.18. <hi>Since we left off to burn incense unto the Queen of Heaven, we have wanted all things.</hi> An Assembly of <hi>Lutherans</hi> once fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such an astonishing and infatuated <hi>Rashness,</hi> when they ascribed the horrid Calamities which wasted <hi>Germany,</hi> unto this, <hi>That the Worship of Images was growing so much out of fashion.</hi> It is not <hi>safe,</hi> but <hi>rash</hi> to say, that the Judgments which are the <hi>consequents</hi> of these and those Transactions, do come as the <hi>Punishments</hi> of those Transactions, unless the Word of God evidently declare the <hi>Transactions</hi> to be <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions</hi> before the Lord. Because that since such a <hi>Year</hi> we have had many a Blast upon us, and since such a <hi>Day</hi> we have had sore Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, <hi>that</hi> is not enough to make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93737:93"/> that what was done such a <hi>Year,</hi> or such a <hi>Day,</hi> is the cause of all the Controversie. Thus also, we may make some <hi>conjecture</hi> upon the <hi>fulfilments</hi> of the <hi>Prophesies</hi> in the Book of God; we may with an humble and modest enquiry guess whereabouts we are upon the <hi>Line <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f Time.</hi> Our Saviour was provoked at them of old, because they flouted at such endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Ye hypocrites, can ye not discern the signs of the times? i. e.</hi> that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty weeks in which the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to come, are almost expired? But we should not be <hi>rash</hi> in such Conjectures; we should have better <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> and <hi>epochs</hi> to build upon, than they that allotted so much upon <hi>Sixty Six</hi> a while ago; we may otherwise plunge our selves into great unhappinesses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Beware of <hi>Rash Enterprizes.</hi> It was a <hi>rash</hi> Expedition that the <hi>Ephraimites</hi> made out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> before the full time of their Deliverance was come. We do <hi>rash</hi> things when we do not go to God for his Direction in them: Thus we read in <hi>Isa.</hi> 30.1. <hi>Wo to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, which take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, but not of me.</hi> When we have any weighty thing to do, we should have God for our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour,</hi> by searching what his <hi>Word</hi> enjoyns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and by begging that our <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> may be disposed by his invisible Influences. While <hi>Israel</hi> was under its <hi>Theocracy,</hi> even till the days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> God sent his Angels audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to instruct from the <hi>Ʋrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> what course to steer when they consulted him. When we don't remember duely to <hi>consult God,</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:93737:94"/> before our great undertakings, he does with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, bitter, deadly disappointments, make us to find, <hi>That we have gone rashly to work.</hi> I pray, let us ask our selves, whether <hi>we</hi> have our selves never found it so! And thus for particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to dispose of themselves in <hi>Marriage,</hi> or to do any thing that their comfort and welfare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much upon; without much <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Fasting</hi> over it, is to be inexcusably <hi>rash.</hi> And as it is <hi>rashness</hi> to enterprize any considerable thing, without consulting our <hi>God,</hi> so 'tis for us to do it without consulting our <hi>Strength.</hi> Says our Lord in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Beware of <hi>Rash Dissatisfactions.</hi> 'Tis no rare thing for Men to grow <hi>dissatisfied</hi> at some of the circumstances that God has placed them in; but it is an easie thing to be <hi>rash</hi> in those <hi>dissatisfactions.</hi> What a <hi>rash</hi> thing was it in the renowned <hi>Elias,</hi> in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.4. <hi>He sat down under a Juniper-tree, and requested for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he might dye, and said, Now, O Lord, take away my life.</hi> But, good Sir, what if God had granted this <hi>rash</hi> Request of yours, had not you been a loser by it? Why, 'tis an old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That many an eminent Man sits under</hi> Elias<hi>'s Juniper tree.</hi> Men that are in publick places, had need look to their own Spirits, lest by some <hi>distaste</hi> and <hi>leven</hi> in them. they provoke the God of Heaven to deprive them of all their precious opportunities to serve their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93737:94"/> When <hi>Moses</hi> had a most unworthy and unthankful People under him, it is said in <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.32. <hi>It went ill with Moses for their sakes; because they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly with his lips.</hi> A Person that moves in any large <hi>sphere</hi> of serviceableness, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find a perverse and froward World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite him very basely for it; but let him not now be carried away with such a discontent, as to resolve, <hi>I will not be an healer to such a People; I'll do no more for them; they shall sink or swim for all me.</hi> Sir, this may be such an <hi>unadvisedness</hi> as the Holy God may chastise, by throwing of you by among those that he will never use for the good of his People any more. And thus also, it becomes particular Persons to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>dissatisfactions</hi> at whatever estate God may see needful for them. Our Lord said in <hi>John</hi> 13.7. <hi>What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.</hi> You can't say, when things go too <hi>fast,</hi> or too <hi>slow,</hi> an <hi>Imprisonment</hi> has ere now been the way to an <hi>Advancement.</hi> On the other side, when the <hi>discontents</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons drive them to <hi>rash Wishes</hi> and <hi>rash Speeches,</hi> 'tis well if the God that hears them all, say not <hi>Amen</hi> unto them. I have heard an angry <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> say, <hi>He car'd not whether he ever saw such a Child again;</hi> and God has taken care that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he never did. So will a weary <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> say, <hi>She hopes this is the last Child she shall ever have;</hi> and God has taken care that she has had none perfect or living after it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Beware of <hi>Rash Zeal.</hi> We read of some in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. <hi>They have a zeal of God, but

Moreover, 'tis but a <hi>rash Zeal</hi> for a Man to revile an <hi>Opinion,</hi> which for ought he does yet infallibly know, may be <hi>a Glorious Truth of God.</hi> It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that many things may be quickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and entertained as blessed Mysteries about the <hi>Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> which yet from the time that the <hi>Kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> has been in play, to this very day, the multitudes of good Men have with a <hi>Rash Zeal,</hi> bestowed shameful, railing, and odious Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters upon. Let us beware of all this <hi>Rashness.</hi> And in opposition thereunto, let me recommend these two things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Let nothing be done too <hi>suddenly.</hi> Let us be Men of <hi>Thoughts.</hi> It was the practice of an Holy Man, which Preached many scores of Sermons in this very Pulpit long ago, That if any important <hi>Question</hi> were asked him, he would not give an <hi>Answer</hi> thereunto, before he had made a <hi>pause</hi> which had some secret and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Ejaculations</hi> in it. O did we but keep our <hi>pauses</hi> well, there would be a general <hi>Harmony</hi> in our Lives! The <hi>Jews</hi> Report, that old <hi>Adam</hi> used to say, <hi>A Man would never do amiss, if he saw from the beginning to the end.</hi> And it was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93737:104"/> once the Mode of no rash Person, when he saw any Man in haste upon any thing, to say, <hi>Pray stay a little, and we shall have done the sooner!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let nothing be done too <hi>Angrily.</hi> Be assured, nothing is done so well in <hi>Anger,</hi> but what may be done better out of it. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, if he were <hi>Angry,</hi> would say, or do nothing till he had repeated, over all the Letters of the <hi>Alphabet.</hi> When a Man is <hi>Angry</hi> he's meerly <hi>Frantick.</hi> If your <hi>Anger</hi> be up, e'en make a stop; say nothing, do nothing, till at least you have gone over the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> or some such way cooled the <hi>Fever.</hi> All will be <hi>Rash</hi> while the <hi>Anger</hi> holds. I need only add that Oracle in <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. <hi>With the well-advised is wisdom.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE greatest Blessedness that any <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creature</hi> can arrive unto, is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in these Words. Words very fit to drop from the Pen of a Man that had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the <hi>Third Heaven</hi> among the Angels of God.</p>
            <p>The Christianised <hi>Ephesians</hi> had once too much dived into the <hi>Depths of Satan,</hi> by their <hi>unlawful Arts.</hi> At their Conversion, such was their <hi>Self-denial,</hi> that they burned the <hi>Manuscripts</hi> from
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93737:106"/> which they had their cursed Skill, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Luke</hi>'s Computation, the value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was near Sixteen Hundred Pound Sterling. Behold them well-requited here; they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with an Inspired Epistle, wherein the <hi>deep things of God</hi> are set before them. The <hi>chief things of the ancient mountains,</hi> the <hi>precious things of the everlasting Hills,</hi> the great Mysteries of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> and <hi>Free grace,</hi> are handled in this Epistle, truly so as not in any other. <hi>Paul</hi> himself appeals to this Epistle, as not the least Evidence of his claim to <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Excellent Apostle was now <hi>Prisoner</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> That was no doubt a sore Exercise unto his Children, his People at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them under it, like a watchful <hi>Pastor,</hi> yea, like a tender <hi>Father,</hi> he sends them word, <hi>Though I cannot preach to you, yet I do pray for you.</hi> Our Context here tells us for what he prayed. A <hi>Father</hi> for his Children, a <hi>Pastor</hi> for his People, cannot make a better <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prayers</hi> of such a Man as <hi>Paul,</hi> sure they are very <hi>remarkable,</hi> very <hi>imitable</hi> Prayers. There are, I think, <hi>Seven</hi> of those Supplications, beside what are in the <hi>Salutations,</hi> occurring in his <hi>Writings:</hi> Of them, This is one. It is a <hi>Prayer</hi> made up of <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> In the <hi>Petition</hi> we have the <hi>Object</hi> and the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Prayer.</hi> The <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Prayer</hi> has Four great Things contained in it: The <hi>Fourth</hi> and the <hi>greatest</hi> of which is that which falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Discourse at this Time. You may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Three <hi>Blessings</hi> petitioned for; <hi>Spiritual
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93737:106"/> Blessings in Heavenly Matters.</hi> In those Three <hi>Blessings,</hi> the Interests, the Efficacies of all the Three Persons in the Trinity, towards Believers, are distinctly wished for. The <hi>Prayer</hi> is for the <hi>strengthening</hi> Influence of God the <hi>Spirit;</hi> for the <hi>in-dwelling</hi> Presence of God the <hi>Son;</hi> for the <hi>revealed Love</hi> of God the <hi>Father.</hi> But the last Blessing of all, takes in the whole <hi>Godhead</hi> for the <hi>Basis</hi> of it. This is the Highest Prayer that no less than an Apostle <hi>full of God</hi> could make for any Persons, — <hi>That ye might be filled with all the Fulness of God.</hi> The Doctrine before us is,
<q>To be filled with all the Fulness of God is an Attainment much to be desired.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Two <hi>Propositions</hi> are to be insisted on, for the <hi>Illustration</hi> of this Truth.</p>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <head>
                  <hi>PROP.</hi> I.</head>
               <p>To be <hi>filled with all the Fulness of God,</hi> is a thing very far <hi>attainable.</hi> This Apostle joins this thing with such things as <hi>all Saints</hi> do <hi>attain</hi> in some measure, to some experience of. The only thing to be now enquired, is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is that Fulness of God, which we are to labour for?</hi> Or, <hi>When may a Man be said to be filled with all the Fulness of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>filling,</hi> truly it is a thing better <hi>felt</hi> than <hi>spoke:</hi> But what shall then be said about the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93737:107"/>
                  <hi>Fulness</hi> it self, of which it is? It is one of the <hi>unutterable things,</hi> yea, it is one of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable things,</hi> which we are concerned in. We may say, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not seen it, nor Ear heard it.</hi> But that we may attempt a little at it; —The <hi>Fulness</hi> of God, is that <hi>Communication</hi> from God, wherewith he gives at once <hi>Employment,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> unto the Souls of Men. A Man is then <hi>filled</hi> with the <hi>Fulness</hi> of God, when he is <hi>viewing</hi> of, and <hi>acting</hi> on, the <hi>Fulness</hi> in God. The Man thus <hi>filled,</hi> is both filled <hi>by</hi> God, and also filled <hi>with</hi> God. God is the <hi>Author</hi> by which, God is the <hi>Object</hi> from which, the Powers of the Soul are filled, when a Man is <hi>filled with all the Fulness of God.</hi> The Vacuities, the Disorders caused in the Soul, by Sin, <hi>Original,</hi> or <hi>Actual,</hi> are by this <hi>Filling</hi> rectified. When the <hi>Fulness</hi> of God is <hi>filling</hi> of a Man, then the <hi>Graces</hi> of God are bestowed on him, the <hi>Glories</hi> of God are affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him. Both of these go together; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether therefore let us handle them.</p>
               <p>O that our God may <hi>keep these things in the Imagination of the Thoughts of our Hearts for ever.</hi> Not accurate Scholarship, but <hi>experimental Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> alone will help us to conceive of these things. To particularize, —thus let us <hi>think,</hi> thus let us <hi>do</hi> and <hi>live.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <p n="1">1. A Man that is <hi>filled with all the Fulness of God,</hi> is <hi>filled</hi> with a continual <hi>Apprehension</hi> about God. How does God <hi>fill</hi> a Man? It is by causing that Man to acknowledge him as the God who <hi>fills</hi> the World. It is the Demand of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93737:107"/> the great God, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Do not I fill Heaven and Earth? saith the Lord.</hi> Truly, The Lord <hi>fills</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> of a Man, by enabling the Man to discern that <hi>Fulness</hi> of His which <hi>fills Heaven and Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Man that is <hi>full of God,</hi> beholds <hi>God</hi> in every <hi>place.</hi> The Man goes not into any corner, but he says within himself, <hi>The Eye of the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresent God is now upon me.</hi> When the Man is trying to do a <hi>good</hi> thing, he thus encourages himself, <hi>God sees me, and will reward me, if I do it:</hi> When the Man is tempted to do a <hi>bad</hi> thing, he thus antidotes himself, <hi>God sees me, and will destroy me, if I do it.</hi> That Man sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes to this Article in <hi>David</hi>'s Confession of Faith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.7. I can go <hi>no whither from the presence of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, A Man that is <hi>full of God,</hi> beholds God in every <hi>thing.</hi> He sees the <hi>Face</hi> of God in every <hi>Work</hi> of God. This Man sticks not in <hi>any Creatures,</hi> stays not at <hi>Second Causes;</hi> with a spiritualized Soul, he soars up to <hi>God</hi> in all.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>filled</hi> Man sees <hi>God</hi> in all the Works of <hi>Creation.</hi> He looks upon the whole World, as the <hi>Building,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> of God; <hi>Praesentemque docet quaelibet herba Deum.</hi> He sees God in every thing, from the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Firmament, to the <hi>Stone</hi> in the Pavement. He looks upon every thing in the World, with such a Sense of it, <hi>The Finger of God is here; this is a thing subsisting not of it self, or for it self, but in God, and for God.</hi> He disputes like <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24, 28. <hi>God made the World, and all things therein; In Him we have our Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:93737:108"/>
                  <p>The <hi>filled</hi> Man sees God in all the Works of <hi>Providence</hi> too. Nothing happens in the <hi>World,</hi> but he says of it, <hi>This comes from that God whose Kingdom ruleth over all.</hi> He ascribes nothing to <hi>Casualty,</hi> nothing to <hi>Fatality,</hi> and but little to Humane <hi>Industry.</hi> He accounts not of God as an Idle <hi>Spectator</hi> or <hi>Supervisor</hi> of Things here below: He is fully of that Belief, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Not a Sparrow falls to the ground without God.</hi> And nothing happens to himself, but he says of it, <hi>This is by the ordering of that God who perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things for me.</hi> He looks upon his <hi>Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> as the <hi>Smiles</hi> of God. He doth not say, <hi>By my Wisdom, by my Traffick, have I gotten Gold and Silver.</hi> No; but he says, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 11.13. <hi>This is the Lords doing.</hi> He says of all his Mercies, as <hi>Jacob</hi> said of his <hi>Children, These are the things that God hath graciously given me.</hi> He looks upon his <hi>Afflictions</hi> as the <hi>Rods</hi> of God. He doth not say, <hi>My Affliction comes out of the Dust, my Trouble springs out of the Ground.</hi> No; but he says, as he in <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Yea, though the <hi>Hand</hi> of Man, though the <hi>Rage</hi> of Man be never so much in his Troubles, still he says, <hi>It is God that bad</hi> Shimei <hi>curse; It is God that sent the</hi> Chaldeans <hi>to spoil.</hi> In short, This Man hath not many waking Hours without some <hi>Thoughts</hi> on God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Man that is <hi>filled with all the Fulness of God,</hi> is <hi>filled</hi> with a gracious <hi>Resemblance</hi> of God. In the Blessed God, there is a <hi>Fulness</hi> of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. A good Man in his measure, hath
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93737:108"/> something of that <hi>Fulness</hi> imprinted on himself; the <hi>Glory</hi> of God shines upon him, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tle of his <hi>Image,</hi> he reflects a little of that <hi>Brightness.</hi> A Man <hi>filled</hi> with God, —that Man, according to the poor Capacity of a Man, comes to be <hi>all that</hi> which <hi>God is. To be filled with God,</hi> —We have a Paraphrase upon it, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Be followers of God as dear Children.</hi> A Man <hi>full of God,</hi> is a Man <hi>following of God.</hi> This <hi>Godly</hi> Man is a <hi>God-like</hi> Man. He sees that God is an <hi>Holy</hi> God; hereupon he resolves with himself, <hi>If God have no pleasure in wickedness, If God be of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, I will always be an Hater of Sin too.</hi> He sees that God is a <hi>Righteous</hi> God; hereupon again he resolves with himself, <hi>Since Gods Judgments always be Righteous, my Carriages never shall be Injurious.</hi> He sees that God is a <hi>Merciful</hi> God; hereupon this Man too endeavours evermore to be <hi>giving</hi> and <hi>forgiving,</hi> as like his <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> as he can. We are advised in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. to be <hi>holy as God is holy.</hi> We are advised in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. to be <hi>perfect as God is perfect.</hi> This it is to be <hi>filled with God.</hi> To be full of <hi>Grace</hi> is to be full of <hi>God.</hi> It is glanced at in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>You are made partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> The Man filled with the <hi>Fulness</hi> of God is filled with the <hi>Nature</hi> of God. God forbid we should use the Gibbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of the Blasphemous <hi>Familist;</hi> or talk of being <hi>Godded with God.</hi> But thus, A godly Man has a New <hi>Nature</hi> in him, a New <hi>Temper</hi> in him. It is <hi>Divine</hi> for the Original which it is a <hi>Copy</hi> of. When a Man is <hi>full of God,</hi> then he <hi>loves</hi> where God <hi>loves,</hi> he <hi>hates</hi> as God <hi>hates.</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:93737:109"/>
'Tis the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Man, 'tis his <hi>Temper</hi> so to do; the <hi>Holiness,</hi> the <hi>Righteousness,</hi> the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God are <hi>copied</hi> out upon him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Man that is <hi>filled with all the Fulness of God,</hi> is <hi>filled</hi> with a dutiful <hi>compliance</hi> with God. When the <hi>Actions</hi> of Man answer to the <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> of God, then God fills that Man. Where God <hi>fills</hi> Man, there Man <hi>owns</hi> Him. The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty</hi> of God, —Let this <hi>fill</hi> a Man, with Acts of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and <hi>Resignation.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> was <hi>full</hi> of God, he could say, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>I opened not my mouth because thou didst it.</hi> The <hi>Justice</hi> of God, —Let this <hi>fill</hi> a Man with Acts of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Humiliation.</hi> When <hi>Daniel</hi> was <hi>full</hi> of God, he said in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.8. <hi>O Lord, unto us belongs confusion of face, —because we have sinned.</hi> The <hi>Power</hi> of God, —Let this <hi>fill</hi> a Man with Acts of <hi>Dependance.</hi> When <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> was <hi>full</hi> of God, he said, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. <hi>O our God, we know not what to do; but our Eyes are upon thee.</hi> And the <hi>Kindness</hi> of God, —Let this <hi>fill</hi> a Man with <hi>Love,</hi> with <hi>Praise,</hi> with all manner of <hi>Thankfulness.</hi> The Psalmist was <hi>full</hi> of God, when he cryed out in <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.12. <hi>What shall I render to the Lord for all his Benefits!</hi> There are <hi>incommunicable,</hi> as well as <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi> Attributes in the most High God. We cannot <hi>partake</hi> of the former as of the latter; but we should however <hi>Answer</hi> to both. Let every <hi>Attribute</hi> of God leave blessed Impressions of <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> in us; then are we <hi>filled with God.</hi> The pious <hi>Romans</hi> were thus <hi>filled;</hi> of whom we read, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When God <hi>fills</hi> a Man, the Man sees that in God which calls for all his <hi>wonderments</hi> for his endless <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> In <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.8. we read of <hi>a mouth filled with Gods praise.</hi> A <hi>Man</hi> is <hi>full</hi> of God, when his <hi>Praise</hi> is <hi>full</hi> of God, when his <hi>Mind</hi> is full of <hi>Praise.</hi> There is a particular way of <hi>praising God,</hi> which only Men that are <hi>filled with his fulness</hi> are used unto. <hi>Absolute</hi> Praises, <hi>abstracted</hi> Praises; with such <hi>Praises</hi> we should admire and adore the Almighty God. Sometimes the <hi>kindness</hi> of God <hi>fills</hi> our <hi>Praises;</hi> we <hi>bless</hi> him, we <hi>thank</hi> him for his Favours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our selves. This is well; but this is not enough, the <hi>fulness</hi> of God should also <hi>fill</hi> our <hi>Praises;</hi> then, then it <hi>fills</hi> our <hi>Souls.</hi> In such an high strain the <hi>Doxologies</hi> of the Apostles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten run. We have also an illustrious Instance of such <hi>Praises</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. throughout; it is entituled <hi>Davids Praise:</hi> The Psalmist therein <hi>praiseth</hi> God, not for any benefit proper to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but for the <hi>greatness</hi> of the <hi>Excellencies</hi> that are in God. O that now the most <hi>feeble</hi> among us may be as <hi>David!</hi> We should be <hi>filled</hi> with <hi>Admirations</hi> at the infinite <hi>Glory</hi> which is in that God whose Name is <hi>exalted above all Blessing and Praise.</hi> 'Tis said of one that knew how to <hi>praise God</hi> aright, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.24. <hi>In my Name shall his Horn be exalted.</hi> There is an <hi>exalted Horn</hi> which a good Man should be desirous of. But what is that? For my part I think the meaning of it may be fetched from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.5. where we read of <hi>words to lift up the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93737:110"/> Horn.</hi> With <hi>Horns</hi> or <hi>Cornets,</hi> did they of old use to sound out the <hi>Praises of God.</hi> Our <hi>Horn</hi> is to be <hi>exalted.</hi> How so? Thus our <hi>Praise</hi> is to be <hi>exalted;</hi> it is to sound higher and higher than at the common rate. We should exalt our <hi>Horn,</hi> and our <hi>Praise</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> of God; fill it with a big sound of his ever glorious <hi>Name,</hi> though we may have perhaps but small <hi>Notes</hi> of our own <hi>Comforts</hi> or <hi>Delights,</hi> of which to compose our Songs. Though our own circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances be never so bad or hard, yet we should in the very <hi>Belly of Hell</hi> be with many <hi>Praises</hi> adoring the unsearchable <hi>Glories</hi> which belong to God; our Souls in a praising Admiration should spread themselves upon all the <hi>fulness of God:</hi> So, O so, we shall be <hi>filled</hi> with it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A Man that is <hi>filled with all the fulness of God,</hi> is <hi>filled</hi> with an unspeakable <hi>contentation</hi> in God. A <hi>Delight</hi> in God fills the Soul that is filled with the <hi>fulness</hi> of God. When God fills a Man, that Man counts himself to have enough in God. <hi>One God</hi> weighs down <hi>Ten Worlds</hi> in the resentments of this Man. He doth <hi>rejoyce in the Lord;</hi> I say again, he doth <hi>rejoyce in the Lord;</hi> and no earthly <hi>wants,</hi> no particular <hi>woes</hi> can hinder him from doing so. There is a blessed intercourse between God and Man, in this case. God says, as it was said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>I am thy exceeding great reward.</hi> Well, now Man says, as it was said by <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.6. <hi>The Lord is my inheritance, and I have a goodly heritage.</hi> A Man that is <hi>full</hi> of God, sees that God is his <hi>portion;</hi> and this causes
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93737:110"/> his triumphing rejoycing Soul to say, <hi>I am full, I am full, this is all my Salvation, and all my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</hi> When a Man is gloriously refreshed with the <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> of God, then he is filled with <hi>all the fulness</hi> of God. The <hi>Favour</hi> of God, the <hi>Fellowship</hi> of God, fills that Man with sweet, quiet, joyful frames, in the absence of all other things. When <hi>David</hi> had lost all he had in the World, yet it is said in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. <hi>He incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged himself in the Lord his God.</hi> There was a Man <hi>full of God!</hi> Such a Man, if he lose the <hi>good Will</hi> of other Men, he counts that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> priviledge <hi>to be the Friend of God,</hi> is better than <hi>Pilates</hi> ambition <hi>to be the Friend of</hi> Caesar; he comforts himself in this, <hi>God is my Friend still, and his loving kindness is better than Life.</hi> If he lose his <hi>Estate,</hi> he counts that he hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spilt a <hi>Cup</hi> of Water, while he hath a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of Living Water at his Door; he says, <hi>When I have no Bags, or Lands, or Ships, yet will I joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> To say no more, if he lose the dearest of his <hi>Relations,</hi> yet he finds, he feels that in one <hi>God,</hi> which abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>fills</hi> up the room of all.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A Man that is <hi>filled with all the fulness of God,</hi> is <hi>filled</hi> with a perpetual <hi>dedication</hi> to God. God fills the <hi>Souls</hi> when God fills the <hi>Aims</hi> of Men. It was the mean Character of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.1. <hi>He is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit unto himself.</hi> But where you see a Man bringing forth <hi>Fruit</hi> to God, you may say, <hi>There is a full Man, a Man full of God.</hi> Such a Man hath his glances at <hi>inferiour ends,</hi> but all those <hi>ends</hi> are <hi>swallowed</hi> up in God. When God fills
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93737:111"/> a Man, that Man can't with any Patience think that any but <hi>God</hi> should have his <hi>time,</hi> his <hi>strength,</hi> his <hi>all.</hi> He <hi>dedicates</hi> unto God all that he <hi>doth.</hi> He is driving a <hi>Trade</hi> for God in all. For this it is that he <hi>eats,</hi> he <hi>drinks,</hi> he <hi>sleeps,</hi> and the rest; he thinks with himself, <hi>I will not do these things as a Beast, only to gratifie a Natural Appetite; but I will do them that I may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the Service of God.</hi> For this he <hi>labours,</hi> for this he <hi>visits</hi> too; yea, for this he performs and attends the <hi>Worship</hi> of God. He is able to say, <hi>This is that God may be glorified!</hi> The Rule he goes by is that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Do all to the glory of God.</hi> And he <hi>dedicates</hi> unto God all that he <hi>hath.</hi> All the <hi>Powers</hi> of his Mind, all the <hi>Members</hi> of his Body, he gives unto God in a <hi>Covenant never to be forgotten.</hi> He devotes unto God all his <hi>Credit,</hi> all his <hi>Estate,</hi> all his <hi>Interest;</hi> as we read of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Psal</hi> 30.1. that the very Hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Finally, It is the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried study of this Man, how to promote the <hi>glory</hi> of God in the World; he is always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, <hi>O what, what shall I do for my dear God!</hi> This it is to be <hi>full</hi> of <hi>him.</hi> A Soul <hi>fixed</hi> on God, is a Soul <hi>filled</hi> with God.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p n="2">II. To be <hi>filled with all the fulness of God</hi> is an Attainment very much <hi>desirable.</hi> Here is a <hi>Prayer</hi> for a <hi>Paul!</hi> The Apostle had no sooner mentioned this, but he adds, <hi>Now unto him that is able to do above all that we ask or think, be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Truly we cannot <hi>ask</hi> or <hi>think</hi> an higher thing than this, <hi>O that I may be filled with all
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93737:111"/> the fulness of God!</hi> Two things are to be said of this being thus <hi>filled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> It is <hi>Holiness,</hi> and therefore it is <hi>desirable. Holiness</hi> is <hi>desirable;</hi> every Man should desire it. The Psalmist could say, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>The holy are the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi> It becomes us to say, <hi>Holiness is excellence, of which is all my desire.</hi> Well, but what is <hi>Holiness?</hi> It lies not principally in <hi>Parties,</hi> in <hi>Garments,</hi> or in the Rites of a Superstitious <hi>Pharisee.</hi> No, but for a Man to be <hi>filled with all the fulness of God,</hi> for a Man to have God <hi>possessing</hi> of him, to have God <hi>influencing</hi> of him; this is true <hi>Holiness.</hi> Such a Man may truly be called, <hi>A man of God;</hi> he is a very <hi>Holy</hi> Man. The <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> of old was a very <hi>holy</hi> place. Why? we read in <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34. <hi>The glory of the Lord filled it.</hi> Thus the <hi>Christian</hi> becomes a very <hi>holy</hi> Man, when <hi>the fulness of the Lord filleth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is <hi>Happiness,</hi> and therefore again it is <hi>desirable. Happiness</hi> is <hi>desirable;</hi> every Man <hi>doth</hi> desire it. The unanimous voice of all Mankind is that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Who will show us good?</hi> Who will? Why, God will; nothing else can. Do we ask after <hi>good?</hi> Behold, all the poor things of <hi>Earth,</hi> and of <hi>Time,</hi> proclaim aloud unto us, <hi>Good is not in me! Good is not in me!</hi> There is <hi>vanity</hi> in them, there is <hi>vexation</hi> in them, but no <hi>good:</hi> Where then is <hi>good?</hi> 'Tis determined in <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.28. <hi>It is good for me to draw near unto God.</hi> The Man that is filled with <hi>God,</hi> is filled with <hi>good.</hi> To be full
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93737:112"/> of <hi>Riches,</hi> to be full of <hi>Honours,</hi> to be full of <hi>Children,</hi> will not make a Man <hi>happy.</hi> The <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of Man will <hi>starve</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> if it have no other <hi>fulness</hi> to be nourished by. O but to be full of <hi>God;</hi> —this is no less than <hi>Heaven</hi> it self. It is the description of <hi>Heaven</hi> it self in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. that <hi>God is all in all</hi> there. The <hi>Soul</hi> of Man was <hi>framed</hi> for none but God, is <hi>suited</hi> by none but God. For a Man to take his leave of all inferiour things, and to be wholly taken up with <hi>God</hi> instead of all, —this is the <hi>Heaven of Heaven</hi> it self. 'Tis impossible that a Man <hi>full</hi> of God ever should be miserable.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There is a twofold <hi>fulness</hi> which is by many preferred before <hi>all the fulness of God. O foolish p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>Mammon,</hi> which many
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93737:112"/> dote upon. The Lord said unto them in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.11. that he would give them <hi>Houses full of all good things.</hi> Many persons think that better than to have <hi>Hearts full of all good things.</hi> A <hi>full</hi> Purse, a <hi>full</hi> House, a <hi>full</hi> Barn; this the most of Men are for. But who is for a <hi>full Soul?</hi> We are told in <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The men of the world, God fills them with his treasures.</hi> The World is <hi>full</hi> of Men that care to be <hi>filled</hi> no otherwise than so. A vast deal of <hi>Wealth,</hi> and as little of <hi>God</hi> as needs must; this will very well serve their turn. We may speak to these Men in the Language that one of the Antients has, <hi>They have Incarnated their own Souls.</hi> Woful Men; they make their <hi>Souls</hi> to be content with no other <hi>fulness</hi> than what their <hi>Flesh</hi> calleth for. These persons are much to be pityed and reproved. Thy Soul will one day be stript of all this <hi>fulness;</hi> and what shall then become of that naked, shiftless, perishing Soul? Methinks that voice of God may fall as a Thunder-bolt of <hi>Death</hi> upon the Heart of such a Man, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.20. <hi>Thy soul shall be required of thee, then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?</hi> It was once the moan of <hi>Naomi, I was full, but I am become empty.</hi> This, this, will be the shriek of thy <hi>friendless, helpless,</hi> ill provided Soul at its departure hence, <hi>I am empty, I am undone for evermore.</hi> They that thus contemn the <hi>fulness</hi> of God must at last endure the <hi>vengeance</hi> of God. These are the very persons of whom the Lord hath sworn in his <hi>wrath,</hi> they shall never <hi>enter into my rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:93737:113"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is the <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> which many are notorious for. It was an expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion used with a <hi>Lyar,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy heart?</hi> This may be said unto the <hi>Drunkard,</hi> the <hi>Swearer,</hi> the <hi>Gamester,</hi> the <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,</hi> the <hi>Reviler,</hi> the <hi>Sabbath-breaker,</hi> the <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean person,</hi> and the rest, <hi>Thou art not filled with God, but Satan hath filled thy forlorn doleful heart.</hi> We read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. of them that are <hi>full of envy.</hi> We read in <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.12. of them that are <hi>full of violence.</hi> We read in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.28. of them that are <hi>full of hypocrisie and iniquity.</hi> O sad sights! It is a dismal thing to see a Man under <hi>Bodily</hi> possession by the Devil; but these Men are under a <hi>Spiritual</hi> possession by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which is worse by far.

Man, thy Soul is not full of <hi>God,</hi> it will then be full of <hi>Sin;</hi> but when <hi>Sin</hi> is come <hi>unto the full,</hi> how swift, how sore will <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> be?

'Tis the warning of God in <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.8. <hi>In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall drink.</hi> God preserve us all from being <hi>filled</hi>

               <p>Let it now be the endeavour of us all, <hi>That we may be filled with all the fulness of God.</hi> The best Men living need to be thus called upon. In respect of our <hi>fitness</hi> for Heaven, we are all too much deficient. The <hi>fulness</hi> of God must have a little more hold of us, and all will be well. Let what is <hi>lacking in</hi> our <hi>Faith,</hi> in our <hi>Hope,</hi> in our <hi>Love, be perfected;</hi> then we shall be ready for our Change. A little more of <hi>God,</hi> and then perhaps we shall be <hi>meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But especially these two Thoughts may awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us in the pursuit of this great thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Let a Man be <hi>full of God,</hi> and that's the way for him to be <hi>full of Joy.</hi> God is <hi>Light,</hi> God is <hi>Life:</hi> When God comes into any Soul, he most effectually saith, <hi>Peace be unto this Soul.</hi> The Man that has much of God in him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without much of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> We read in <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.11. about <hi>fulness of joy.</hi> Whence is a <hi>fulness of joy</hi> to be derived, but from a <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God?</hi> Truly <hi>he that dwells in the high and holy place,</hi> doth also dwell in the Spirit of this Man, strongly <hi>reviving,</hi> strangely <hi>refreshing</hi> of him. Such Raptures of <hi>Joy</hi> do sometimes fill the Soul of such a Man, that he is ready to swoon and faint under them; he is forced to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93737:114"/> cry out, <hi>Lord, It is enough! O stay thy hand, I can bear no more! Now I know that God is my only God, and that he will bless me for evermore.</hi> No doubt some in this Assembly have had such Transports of <hi>Joy,</hi> when under the <hi>plenitude</hi> of the <hi>Almighty.</hi> But I have a better, a greater thing than this yet to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let a Man be <hi>full of God,</hi> and that's the way for him to be <hi>full of use.</hi> He will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a most <hi>useful</hi> Man. It is the method of God, first to <hi>fill</hi> a Man, and then to <hi>use</hi> that Man. There is an <hi>Ecclesiastical History</hi> which tells us of a Minister, whom God used for the Conversion of very many Souls; and it gives us this Character of him; —it is in <hi>Acts</hi> 11.24. <hi>He was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith;</hi> and so by his means, <hi>much people was added unto the Lord.</hi> Let God be <hi>in</hi> a Man, and God will be <hi>with</hi> him. God will <hi>direct</hi> that Man, God will <hi>prosper</hi> that Man, who is <hi>full</hi> of him. Though <hi>Dominion,</hi> as they say, <hi>is not founded in Grace;</hi> yet the more of <hi>Grace,</hi> and the more of <hi>God</hi> there is in a Man, the more fit he is to discharge all <hi>relations,</hi> to sustain all <hi>capacities.</hi> The Man that is <hi>full of God,</hi> is as a lighted Lanthorn; God shines in him, and through him, upon all that are about him; one shall hardly come into the company of that Man, but carry something of <hi>God</hi> away. This Man has the Blessing of <hi>Abraham, He is made a Blessing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that we may obtain this <hi>fulness,</hi> all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God are profitable. Ply them
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93737:114"/> all. They are all the <hi>Golden Pipes</hi> by which this <hi>fulness</hi> is conveyed. But I shall particularly offer only Two <hi>Rules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Let our Lives be filled with much <hi>Prayer</hi> to God, and our Souls will be filled with all the <hi>fulness</hi> of God. It is the Promise of God in <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> Frequent and fervent <hi>Prayers</hi> will marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously dispose us to receive the <hi>fulness</hi> of him, who <hi>fills</hi> only the <hi>hungry with good things.</hi> Then be much in Prayer; and especially, be much in two sorts of <hi>Prayers,</hi> in <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Prayers, and in <hi>Ejaculatory</hi> Prayers; let a Man have the former often in a <hi>Year,</hi> let a Man have the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter often in a <hi>Day;</hi> it will then soon be said, <hi>There is much of God in that Man.</hi> The Soul <hi>praying</hi> unto God, is the Soul <hi>panting</hi> after God. It shall be <hi>filled</hi> with him.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Let us be <hi>full of Christ,</hi> and we shall be <hi>full of God.</hi> We have a Saviour, in whom is <hi>the fulness of the Godhead Bodily.</hi> The Man Jesus is more <hi>full of God,</hi> than all the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are. We are informed in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.</hi> What shall be done that we who have been <hi>full of Sin,</hi> and <hi>full of Hell,</hi> may come to be <hi>full of God?</hi> It is the Lord Jesus by whom we must be filled. It is said in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. [for so I would read it, <hi>He fills all in all.] And you hath he filled, who were dead in trespasses and sins.</hi> O let us acquaint our selves much with Jesus
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93737:115"/> Christ. <hi>Study</hi> Christ Jesus, <hi>follow</hi> Christ Jesus, <hi>implore</hi> Christ Jesus; do those three things and Christ Jesus will dispense an incredible <hi>fulness of God</hi> unto you; you shall throughout all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity say, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulness have all we received.</hi>
